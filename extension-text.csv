California Department of Education survey indicated that 87 percent of fourth to eighth graders said that they cook and make some of their meals or snacks. However, youth who lack healthy cooking knowledge may rely on packaged foods or prepared foods containing questionable nutrition value. \xc2\xa0Introducing healthy cooking in schools has many benefits:\xc2\xa0 \n\n \n Children may try new and healthy foods. \xc2\xa0Recent research published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics\xc2\xa0indicates that children engaged in tactile experiences, such as handling foods, have less food neophobia (food fear) and greater acceptance of eating variety of foods. \n\t kitchen is learning lab for children that can involve all of their senses. While kneading, tossing, pouring, smelling, cutting, and feeling foods they have fun and learn without being aware of it. \n\t Children who cook at home indicate \xe2\x80\x9c sense of accomplishment,""\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0self-confidence, and feeling of contributing to their families. \n\t They spend time cooking instead of engaged in screen time. \n\t Children tend to skip less healthy prepared or processed snack foods as they prepare their own food more. \n\t Recent research indicates that nutrition knowledge may be incomplete without the experiential learning or hands-on activities associated with food preparation that involves handling food and cooking equipment. \n\t Children learn lifetime skills through practicing basic math skills such as counting, weighing, measuring, tracking time; they also gain social skills by working together and communicating in the kitchen. \n\t Teaching cooking to youth is an opportunity to teach nutrition education such as planning meals and make smarter food choices. \n\t Cooking can aid children in acceptance of responsibility. Each child has task to complete to contribute the meal preparation and cleanup. \n\t Cooking in schools can build positive memories that promote future healthy, enjoyable cooking elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 \n\t Children ate more fruits and vegetables after participating in culinary classes according to some research studies. \n\t Many research studies show improved changes in cooking knowledge, food safety behaviors, and cooking self-efficacy. \n\t Other studies indicate that teaching nutrition education with food preparation in science class is more effective than in nutrition education science classes without food preparation.\xc2\xa0 \n Many school faculty are beginning to embrace cooking to teach and promote healthier eating.

Murphy \n\n Belief Statements \n\n \n Creating and promoting culture of safety among youth working in agriculture is primary goal for all stakeholders. \n\t All youth working in agriculture deserve protection from workplace hazards and risks that may be associated with agricultural worksites. \n\t Youth developmental principles are the basis for determining if and when youth should participate in agricultural work. \n\t Supervision of youth performing jobs or tasks should be guided by professionally recognized best practices based on developmental stages of growth. \n\t Research and evaluation should guide development of safety and health best practice recommendations and guidelines. \n\t Evidenced-based, culturally appropriate models should be utilized to educate about agricultural safety and health. \n\t Hired youth working on farms subject to Occupational Safety and Health Act enforcement should be informed of applicable rights to safe workplace, training, personal protective equipment, and to ask questions or raise concerns about their safety. \n Guiding Principles for Practice \n\n \n Parents, employers, agricultural educators, healthcare providers, and safety and health professionals play critical roles in designing and implementing youth agricultural safety education and training that is comprehensive, developmentally appropriate, accessible, and effective. \n\t College and university agricultural science and education teacher preparation programs should include agricultural safety and health education that meets Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources (AFNR) Career Cluster Content Standards and/or appropriate state standards. \n\t Secondary school education and programs should include agricultural safety and health education that meets Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources (AFNR) Career Cluster Content Standards and/or appropriate state standards. \n\t Cooperative Extension education and programs should include agricultural safety and health education that is evidenced-based and meets appropriate state standards. Extension educators should consider developing safety and health educational curricula that align with AFNR Career Cluster Content Standards. \n\t Agricultural worksite hazard assessment programs should be in place, including regularly updated safety checklists, injury prevention programs, and regular review of health and safety best practices. \n\t Education and training for parents, employers, and other supervisors of youth workers should include instruction about:\n\t\t \n Existing age-based work laws/regulations \n\t\t\t Physical and cognitive abilities of youth \n\t\t\t Need for appropriate supervision and training \n\t\t\t Basic emergency response practices, both general and specific to the workplace \n\t\t\t Basic hazard and risk reduction techniques such as the safety hierarchy, Job Safety Analysis, injury and near-injury investigations, and lockout/tagout. \n\t\t \n \n \n Youth workers should receive basic training in proper body mechanics due to musculoskeletal changes from physiologic growth and development, and to protect against cumulative effects of exposure to hazards. \n\t Youth should be encouraged to request help and/or additional training when taking on new, unfamiliar task or experiencing difficulty with any specific task. \n\t Parents should and employers must provide opportunities for youth to receive safety and health training specific to any job or task they are assigned to,\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 including but not limited to Job Instruction Training (JIT) and Tailgate Training techniques. \n\t Parents with family farm youth workers should reference current safety and health regulations to better understand high risk activities and best safety practices. \n\t Parents, employers, and other supervising adults are encouraged to help youth obtain safety training through nationally recognized educational curricula and supporting resources such as those listed in the SAY National Clearinghouse. \n\t Parents, employers and other supervising adults should conduct thorough assessment of weather, environmental, and equipment\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 conditions prior to assigning work to youth. \n\t Parents should and employers must provide youth with appropriate personal protective equipment and training in its use and care as required by state and federal regulations. \n\t Hired youth work assignments must be in compliance with state and federal work safety regulations including but not limited to U.S. Department of Labor Hazardous Occupations Orders in Agriculture (Ag HOs); Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) General Industry 1910 and Agriculture 1928 Standards; and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Worker Protection Standards (WPS) and Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA). \n \xc2\xa0 \n\n SAY National Steering Committee \n\n Jim Armbruster, Senior Relations Manager, National FFA Organization R.

Please check here to see other articles in this series. \n \n\n Introduction \n\n Commercially affordable sexed semen (since 2006) and genomic testing (since 2009) have added to the options that dairy farmers should consider when looking to increase profitability. These technologies, combined with good overall management, and older technologies such as embryo transfer or beef semen, lead to an expanded number of choices regarding genetic selection, breeding and culling. Among the options to consider are: \n\n \n which animals to breed \xc2\xa0with sexed semen, \n\t which dairy calves to raise as herd replacements, \n\t which cows to cull, \n\t possible use of beef semen to create crossbred calves, and \n\t whether to use genomic testing. \n The best combination of these practices is often not obvious. This article lays out some of the key principles behind finding these best combinations and discuss results of some combinations that lead to greater profitability. \n\n Please check this link first if you are interested in organic or specialty dairy production \n\n Genetics and Genomic Testing 101 \n\n Genomic testing provides more reliable estimates of the genetic merit of animals than estimates that are only based on the animal\xe2\x80\x99s relatives, and testing can be performed at young age. The parent averages or predicted transmitting abilities (PTA) of the various traits on the genomic test report are the genetic merits that the animal is expected (predicted) to transmit to its offspring (the next generation). The expected genetic merit of the animal itself is the estimated breeding value (EBV), which is PTA EBV. The EBV of Lifetime Net Merit (NM$) differences between animals provide direct estimates of the differences in profit when exploring the economics of genomic testing and breeding decisions. Differences in PTA of NM$ only show half of the profit differences between animals. For example, if two animals have PTA of NM$ of +$300 and +$400, then the difference in lifetime profit is expected to be $200. PTA are expected values of genetic merit but the true genetic merit can be quite different. Genomic testing provides PTA that are on average more similar to the true genetic merit of animals. \n\n How to Evaluate Breeding Schemes \n\n At the University of Florida, we put together herd budget model to evaluate combinations of genomic usages, semen type, and culling rates given herd specific data and prices. The bottom line is to focus on profit per milking cow per year. In this model, dairy calves kept as replacements were valued based on their genetic merit. This genetic merit depends on the genetic merit of the dams and sires of the calves and on the sale value of the surplus heifer calves. greater surplus of dairy calves can be created with sexed semen, but this is at higher cost than using conventional semen and at lower conception rates. Sexed, conventional, and beef semen can be applied to different groups of cattle. Results of some user-defined and optimal breeding schemes are shown in this article. \n\n The cost of genomic testing was set at $50 per tested calf, which included the extra labor cost for obtaining and sending the sample. All born alive dairy calves were tested if genomic testing was applied. Culled cows were sold at approximately half the cost of raising heifers. Dairy bull calves and surplus dairy heifer calves were sold one month after birth at profit of $150 after their expenses. The initial premium for crossbred calf was $75 over the price of dairy bull calf. Many other inputs that affect the outcomes are not shown here but certainly affect the outcomes from the model. The cow cull rate was fixed at 35% and did not vary with breeding scheme. \n\n Optimal Breeding Schemes \n\n The best breeding scheme generates the greatest profitability. This means finding the optimal combinations of semen type (sexed, conventional, or beef) per service number and per parity. The herd budget model can search for these best breeding schemes. constraint is that at least enough dairy heifer calves must be born to replace culled cows. \n\n Scheme #1: Changing premium for crossbred calves \n\n \n\n Figure . User-defined and optimal breeding schemes and profitability depending on the premiums paid for crossbred calves and the use of genomic testing or traditional genetic reliabilities. The top part has user-defined breeding scheme where the top 60% of heifers were bred with sexed semen (se). The bottom 50% of second parity and older cows were bred with beef semen (be). All other breedings in heifers and cows were with conventional semen (co). In the bottom part, no conventional semen is used although this was an option. Profit is expressed as per milking cow per year. \n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n Figure shows results from an analysis where the premium for crossbred calves was set at +$75, +$150 and +$225 over the sale price of purebred dairy bull calves. The top part has user-defined breeding scheme where the top 60% of heifers were bred with sexed semen (se). The bottom 50% of second parity and older cows were bred with beef semen (be). All other breedings in heifers and cows were with conventional semen (co). This scheme resulted in the occurrence of just enough dairy heifer calves to replace culled cows, but there was no surplus. \n\n Profit per milking cow per year increased with greater premium for crossbred calves as expected. Genomic testing resulted in loss of $5 per milking cow per year for all three example premiums. Genomic testing results were used to identify the top 60% heifers to breed with sexed semen, and the bottom 50% of older cows to breed with beef semen, but not for calf selection. \n\n The bottom part of Figure shows results for more profitable breeding schemes. The schemes depended on the premium of crossbred calves and use of more sexed semen. Conventional semen was not used at all. The schemes also depended little on whether genomic testing was used.. Profit per milking cow was increased by $13 to $81 compared to the user-defined scheme in the top part of Figure 1. The better breeding schemes were clearly more profitable than reasonable user-defined breeding scheme. Genomic testing now added additional value compared to relying on traditional genetic reliabilities, but the value decreased with the size of the premium for the crossbred calves. \n\n Scheme #2:\xc2\xa0 Effects of Pregnancy rates \n\n \n\n Figure 2. User-defined and optimal breeding schemes and profitability depending on pregnancy rates and the use of genomic testing or traditional genetic reliabilities. The top part has user-defined breeding scheme where the top 50% of heifers were bred with sexed semen (se). All other breedings in heifers and cows were with conventional semen (co). Beef semen (be) was not allowed to be used. Profit is expressed per milking cow per year. \n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n Figure shows the effect of greater pregnancy rates (\xe2\x89\x8814%, \xe2\x89\x8820%, and \xe2\x89\x8828%) on the profitability and optimal breeding schemes. The set-up was the same as in Figure 1. The user-defined breeding scheme was set with 50% sexed semen in the top heifers and conventional semen in all other animals. The conception rate of sexed semen was assumed to be 80% of the conception rate of conventional semen. Therefore, the pregnancy rates were changed about percentage point when more or less sexed semen was used. \n\n The user-defined schemes resulted in increases profitability with greater pregnancy rates, as might be expected. Genomic testing was not profitable when pregnancy rate was \xe2\x89\x8814% but generated $38 more profit per milking cow per year when pregnancy rate was \xe2\x89\x8828%. At the low pregnancy rate, no surplus calves were available so genomic testing results were only used to select the top 50% of heifers. At the high pregnancy rate, genomic testing was used to select the surplus calves (26% surplus when pregnancy rate was \xe2\x89\x8828%) and again to identify the top heifers to breed with sexed semen. There was clearly strong interaction between the value of genomic testing and cow pregnancy rate in the herd. \n\n The bottom part of Figure 2 shows again increases in profitability over the user-defined scheme in the same situation.\xc2\xa0 Genomic testing resulted in the use of more sexed semen. Genomic testing was profitable even at the lowest pregnancy rate in combination with the use of more sexed semen, which resulted in small surplus of dairy calves. At the highest pregnancy rate, genomic testing resulted in $57 increase in profit per milking cow per year compared to no genomic testing. \n\n The optimal breeding schemes were limited to the use of only sexed and conventional semen in Figure 2. Beef semen was not allowed to be used to help with better comparison with the user-defined scheme. This means that even better breeding schemes are possible when all three breeding types are available at these varying levels of pregnancy rates. \n\n Several pieces of the puzzle were not included in the results shown above. One value of genomic testing is the ability to correct parent misidentification errors. The value of correcting misidentification errors is generally too low by itself to warrant genomic testing, except perhaps to identify elite breeding stock. The analyses above also assumed fixed annual cull rate of 35% to avoid the complicated effects of more or less voluntary culling. Genetic progress in sires is double today from what it was years ago, meaning that heifers are genetically better than cows and incrementally more so than in the recent past. Few studies have investigated the direct effects of genetic improvement on optimal cull rates. Data from these studies allow us to conclude that the economic optimal cull rates continue to depend more on cow depreciation than on accelerated genetic improvement in heifers, but culling should be increased by few percentage units with improvement in the genetic merit of heifer calves born on the farm. \n\n Take Home Messages \n\n \n Genomic testing of females on the farm can be profitable, depending on the fraction of surplus heifers available and smart breeding decisions regarding the use of sexed and beef semen. \n\t Better reproduction makes innovative breeding schemes more profitable. \n\t The opportunity cost of not using innovating breeding schemes is greater than decade ago. \n\t Seek professional help to discover and implement an innovative breeding scheme that combines components of genomics, various semen types, and voluntary culling while protecting the farm\xe2\x80\x99s risk. \n Author Information \n\n Albert DeVries \n\tProfessor, Department of Animal Sciences \n\tUniversity of Florida \n\n Acknowledgment \n\n The model development and analyses in this study were financially supported by USDA NIFA AFRI grant award 2013-68004-20365 titled \xe2\x80\x9cImproving Fertility of Dairy Cattle Using Translational Genomics\xe2\x80\x9d. \n \n\t\t \n\n\t\t Back to Top \n\t\t \n \t\t \n \t\t\t Browse related by Tag \n \n dairy cattle dairy cattle:genetics \n \n \t\t \n \t\t \n \t\t\t Share this post \n \t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n \t\t\t \n \t\t\t \n \t\t\t\t Have Question? \n \t\t\t\t Try asking one of our Experts \n \t\t\t \n \t\t \n\t\t \n\n \n\n \n \n \n Connect with us \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n Welcome \n This is where you can find research-based information from America\'s land-grant universities enabled by eXtension.org \n\n\n \n \n \n Select different institution \n \n \n LOCATE \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n Resources \n Take look at our series of new articles written just for DAIReXNET! \n\n Sign Up for Our Newsletter \n\n Videos \n\n \n Dairy Video Archive \n\t Upcoming Dairy Videos \n Subject Areas \n\n \n Business Management and Farm Labor \n\t Calf and Heifer Management \n\t Facilities \n\t Food Safety \n\t Genetics \n\t Health and Diseases \n\t Mastitis and Milking Management \n\t Materiales en espa\xc3\xb1ol \n\t Milk Marketing \n\t Nutrient Management for Dairies \n\t Nutrition of Milking and Dry Cows \n\t Reproduction \n Other Resources \n\n \n State Newsletters \n\t State Extension Websites \n\t Consumer Links \n\t Contributing Partners \n \n \n \n\n \n \n This work is supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, New Technologies for Ag Extension project. \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n \n View publishing information about this page. \n \n\n\n \n\n \n \n Resource Areas \n Community \n \n Agricultural and Food Law \n Civil Dialogue \n Community Planning and Zoning \n Community, Local and Regional Food Systems \n Cooperatives \n Creating Healthy Communities \n Diversity, Equity and Inclusion \n Enhancing Rural Community Capacity \n Entrepreneurs &amp; Their Communities \n Geospatial Technology \n Internationalizing Extension \n Network Literacy \n Program Evaluation \n Volunteer Administration \n Women in Agriculture \n \n Disaster Issues \n \n Agricultural Disaster Preparedness and Recovery \n Drought Resources \n Floods \n Wildfire \n \n \n \n Energy \n \n Farm Energy \n Home Energy \n Wood Energy \n \n Environment \n \n Prescribed Fire \n Trees for Energy Conservation \n \n Family \n \n Child and Family Learning Network \n Child Care \n Companion Animals \n Drinking Water and Human Health \n Family Caregiving \n Food Safety \n Military Families \n Parenting \n Personal Finance \n \n \n \n Farm \n \n Ag Safety and Health \n Animal Manure Management \n Animal Welfare \n Apples \n Bee Health \n Beef Cattle \n Blueberries \n Climate, Forests and Woodlands \n Dairy \n Forest Farming \n Freshwater Aquaculture \n Goats \n Grapes \n Horses \n Marine Aquaculture \n Organic Agriculture \n Plant Breeding and Genomics \n Sheep \n Small and Backyard Flocks \n Small Meat Processors \n Sustainable Marine Fisheries \n Wood Products \n \n \n \n Health and Nutrition \n \n Community Nutrition Education \n Families, Food and Fitness \n Healthy Food Choices in Schools \n \n Lawn and Garden \n \n Extension Master Gardener \n Gardens &amp; Landscapes \n The Garden Professors \n Water Conservation for Lawn and Landscape \n \n Pest Management \n \n Ant Pests \n Feral Hogs \n Imported Fire Ants \n Invasive Species \n Pest Management In and Around Structures \n Wildlife Damage Management \n \n Youth \n \n Ag Zone \n Science for Youth \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Feeds \n eXtension Members \n Privacy \n Contact Us \n Terms of Use \n \n &copy; 2017 eXtension.

Please check here to see other articles in this series. \n \n\n Introduction \n\n Commercially affordable sexed semen (since 2006) and genomic testing (since 2009) have added to the options that dairy farmers should consider when looking to increase profitability. These technologies, combined with good overall management, and older technologies such as embryo transfer or beef semen, lead to an expanded number of choices regarding genetic selection, breeding and culling. Among the options to consider are: \n\n \n which animals to breed \xc2\xa0with sexed semen, \n\t which dairy calves to raise as herd replacements, \n\t which cows to cull, \n\t possible use of beef semen to create crossbred calves, and \n\t whether to use genomic testing. \n The best combination of these practices is often not obvious. This article lays out some of the key principles behind finding these best combinations and discuss results of some combinations that lead to greater profitability. \n\n Please check this link first if you are interested in organic or specialty dairy production \n\n Genetics and Genomic Testing 101 \n\n Genomic testing provides more reliable estimates of the genetic merit of animals than estimates that are only based on the animal\xe2\x80\x99s relatives, and testing can be performed at young age. The parent averages or predicted transmitting abilities (PTA) of the various traits on the genomic test report are the genetic merits that the animal is expected (predicted) to transmit to its offspring (the next generation). The expected genetic merit of the animal itself is the estimated breeding value (EBV), which is PTA EBV. The EBV of Lifetime Net Merit (NM$) differences between animals provide direct estimates of the differences in profit when exploring the economics of genomic testing and breeding decisions. Differences in PTA of NM$ only show half of the profit differences between animals. For example, if two animals have PTA of NM$ of +$300 and +$400, then the difference in lifetime profit is expected to be $200. PTA are expected values of genetic merit but the true genetic merit can be quite different. Genomic testing provides PTA that are on average more similar to the true genetic merit of animals. \n\n How to Evaluate Breeding Schemes \n\n At the University of Florida, we put together herd budget model to evaluate combinations of genomic usages, semen type, and culling rates given herd specific data and prices. The bottom line is to focus on profit per milking cow per year. In this model, dairy calves kept as replacements were valued based on their genetic merit. This genetic merit depends on the genetic merit of the dams and sires of the calves and on the sale value of the surplus heifer calves. greater surplus of dairy calves can be created with sexed semen, but this is at higher cost than using conventional semen and at lower conception rates. Sexed, conventional, and beef semen can be applied to different groups of cattle. Results of some user-defined and optimal breeding schemes are shown in this article. \n\n The cost of genomic testing was set at $50 per tested calf, which included the extra labor cost for obtaining and sending the sample. All born alive dairy calves were tested if genomic testing was applied. Culled cows were sold at approximately half the cost of raising heifers. Dairy bull calves and surplus dairy heifer calves were sold one month after birth at profit of $150 after their expenses. The initial premium for crossbred calf was $75 over the price of dairy bull calf. Many other inputs that affect the outcomes are not shown here but certainly affect the outcomes from the model. The cow cull rate was fixed at 35% and did not vary with breeding scheme. \n\n Optimal Breeding Schemes \n\n The best breeding scheme generates the greatest profitability. This means finding the optimal combinations of semen type (sexed, conventional, or beef) per service number and per parity. The herd budget model can search for these best breeding schemes. constraint is that at least enough dairy heifer calves must be born to replace culled cows. \n\n Scheme #1: Changing premium for crossbred calves \n\n \n\n Figure . User-defined and optimal breeding schemes and profitability depending on the premiums paid for crossbred calves and the use of genomic testing or traditional genetic reliabilities. The top part has user-defined breeding scheme where the top 60% of heifers were bred with sexed semen (se). The bottom 50% of second parity and older cows were bred with beef semen (be). All other breedings in heifers and cows were with conventional semen (co). In the bottom part, no conventional semen is used although this was an option. Profit is expressed as per milking cow per year. \n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n Figure shows results from an analysis where the premium for crossbred calves was set at +$75, +$150 and +$225 over the sale price of purebred dairy bull calves. The top part has user-defined breeding scheme where the top 60% of heifers were bred with sexed semen (se). The bottom 50% of second parity and older cows were bred with beef semen (be). All other breedings in heifers and cows were with conventional semen (co). This scheme resulted in the occurrence of just enough dairy heifer calves to replace culled cows, but there was no surplus. \n\n Profit per milking cow per year increased with greater premium for crossbred calves as expected. Genomic testing resulted in loss of $5 per milking cow per year for all three example premiums. Genomic testing results were used to identify the top 60% heifers to breed with sexed semen, and the bottom 50% of older cows to breed with beef semen, but not for calf selection. \n\n The bottom part of Figure shows results for more profitable breeding schemes. The schemes depended on the premium of crossbred calves and use of more sexed semen. Conventional semen was not used at all. The schemes also depended little on whether genomic testing was used..

While parents are encouraged to find ways to involve their children in meal preparation at home, many schools are incorporating cooking activities into their health, science and math curricula as way to promote healthy eating. \n\n There are several resources available to schools interested in incorporating cooking into school days or afterschool programming. Cooperative Extension and Cooking Matters may be great places to start. \n\n Cooking Matters is Share Our Strength program founded in 1993 and is part of the No Kid Hungry campaign, which is working to end childhood hunger in America. Through cooking classes and interactive grocery store tours, Cooking Matters partners teach families how to make the most of the food budget so that families prepare affordable, nutritious meals. \n\n Cooking Matters uses collaborative model designed to enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of the cooking classes. Educational materials, training, evaluation, and national leadership are provided by Share Our Strength. Local partners, such as Cooperative Extension, deliver the program to meet the needs of their communities. Cooking Matters partners may already exist in your area \n\n Cooperative Extension agencies in many states across the nation have thriving partnerships with Cooking Matters. Likewise, Cooperative Extension is an excellent resource and is well positioned to help bridge the gap between home and school and increase the impact of nutrition education by providing the same messages to children at school as is given to the parents and adults. \n\n Cooperative Extension educators may be able to come directly to classrooms and/or afterschool programs to provide nutrition lessons, food demonstrations, cooking opportunities, and tasting experiences. Cooperative Extension programs like SNAP-Education, Expanded Food Nutrition Education, and 4-H use research-based curricula for different age groups and grade levels. The lessons are interactive, connected to many of the common core and state standards, and fun!

While parents are encouraged to find ways to involve their children in meal preparation at home, many schools are incorporating cooking activities into their health, science and math curricula as way to promote healthy eating. \n\n There are several resources available to schools interested in incorporating cooking into school days or afterschool programming. Cooperative Extension and Cooking Matters may be great places to start. \n\n Cooking Matters is Share Our Strength program founded in 1993 and is part of the No Kid Hungry campaign, which is working to end childhood hunger in America. Through cooking classes and interactive grocery store tours, Cooking Matters partners teach families how to make the most of the food budget so that families prepare affordable, nutritious meals. \n\n Cooking Matters uses collaborative model designed to enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of the cooking classes. Educational materials, training, evaluation, and national leadership are provided by Share Our Strength. Local partners, such as Cooperative Extension, deliver the program to meet the needs of their communities. Cooking Matters partners may already exist in your area \n\n Cooperative Extension agencies in many states across the nation have thriving partnerships with Cooking Matters. Likewise, Cooperative Extension is an excellent resource and is well positioned to help bridge the gap between home and school and increase the impact of nutrition education by providing the same messages to children at school as is given to the parents and adults. \n\n Cooperative Extension educators may be able to come directly to classrooms and/or afterschool programs to provide nutrition lessons, food demonstrations, cooking opportunities, and tasting experiences. Cooperative Extension programs like SNAP-Education, Expanded Food Nutrition Education, and 4-H use research-based curricula for different age groups and grade levels. The lessons are interactive, connected to many of the common core and state standards, and fun!

Retrieved from http://www.extension.org/pages/62258/hearing-loss-and-protection-for-agricultural-producers \n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n Farmers and ranchers are exposed to loud noises in their work environment on daily basis. Gradual hearing loss is common during the aging process, but noise-induced hearing loss can occur at any age. Noise-induced hearing loss is result of exposure to high-intensity noise without proper hearing protection. Noise-induced hearing loss is preventable by reducing the level of noise at its source and correctly wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \n\n Mechanics of Hearing and Hearing Loss \n\n Sound goes into the ear canal and strikes the eardrum causing it to vibrate. The vibrations create waves that travel to the middle ear forming waves in the cochlea. The cochlea contains small hairlike cells called cilia that wave when they come in contact with the vibration. Once the vibration enters the cochlea, these waves send signal to the brain which interprets them as sounds. Hearing loss occurs when the cilia become flattened and eventually destroyed \xc2\xa0from overstimulation of sound that is too loud or that lasts too long.\xc2\xa0Once \xc2\xa0these\xc2\xa0hair cells (cilia)\xc2\xa0are destroyed they can never be replaced causing permanent hearing loss. \n\n Noise Levels and Duration \n\n Sound loudness or intensity is measured in decibels (dB). In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) establishes guidelines regarding exposure to high levels of noise and recommends that hearing protection be used when you are exposed to minimum sound level of 90 dB for eight hours. However, some individuals have developed noise-induced hearing loss at lower levels. The following table shows the noise exposure levels, maximum time durations set by OSHA, and examples of home and farm equipment with those sound levels. \n\n \n \xc2\xa0 \n\t \n \n Duration per day (hours) \n\t\t\t Sound level dB \n\t\t\t Examples of noise source at sound levels \n\t\t \n \n \n\t\t\t 90 \n\t\t\t Tractor, combine, or ATV \n\t\t \n \n \n\t\t\t 92 \n\t\t\t Tractor or combine \n\t\t \n \n \n\t\t\t 95 \n\t\t\t Tractor, grain grinding, combine, or\xc2\xa0air compressor \n\t\t \n \n \n\t\t\t 97 \n\t\t\t Tractor, combine, or\xc2\xa0shop vacuum \n\t\t \n \n \n\t\t\t 100 \n\t\t\t Tractor, pigs squealing, or\xc2\xa0table saw \n\t\t \n \n 1/2 \n\t\t\t 102 \n\t\t\t Tractor, combine, or riding lawnmower \n\t\t \n \n \n\t\t\t 105 \n\t\t\t Tractor, combine, chickens, or irrigation pump \n\t\t \n \n 1/2 \n\t\t\t 110 \n\t\t\t Tractor or leaf blower \n\t\t \n \n 1/4 \n\t\t\t 115 \n\t\t\t Chainsaw \n\t\t \n \n \xc2\xa0 \n\n Four Ways to Prevent Noise-Induced Hearing Loss \n\n \n \n Noise reduction \xe2\x80\x93 An easy way to reduce noise levels on your farm or ranch is to pay close attention to equipment maintenance such as regular lubrication and replacement of parts. Operating\xc2\xa0 larger equipment at lower speed can also reduce noise levels. The installation of vibration isolation pads under the legs of noisy equipment can reduce the noise from equipment vibration on cement floor. Newer models of certain handheld equipment are equipped with flexible mountings to reduce noise from vibration. \n\t \n Noise isolation \xe2\x80\x93 When purchasing equipment, consider buying tractor or skid-steer that is equipped with sound-reducing cabs and tightly fitting cab doors and windows. These changes can reduce the amount of noise that you hear inside the cab when operating the equipment. \n\t \n Administrative Controls \xe2\x80\x93 As an employer, you can control your workers\' exposure to noise by rotating their workstations to limit their exposure time to jobs with high noise levels. Set up rotation that allows worker to operate noisy machine for specific period of time and then rotate that person to less noisy task. If person already has hearing problem, he or she should not work in high noise areas. \n\t \n Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) \xe2\x80\x93 Use and require your employees to use personal protective equipment such as earplugs and ear muffs to reduce noise exposure.\xc2\xa0 \n Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) \n\n Hearing personal protective equipment (PPE) is measured according to its noise reduction rating (NRR) which is single number that indicates the reduction in decibels when the PPE is properly used. Hearing PPE should have noise reduction rating of at least 25 decibels. Remember that the rating is achieved only when the equipment is properly fitted and worn for the recommended period of time. Earplugs and ear muffs are the most widely used personal protective equipment to reduce noise levels. \n\n Earplugs \n\n Earplugs are either disposable or reusable. \n\n Disposable earplugs: \n\n \n Are designed to fit into the ear opening. \n\t Should never be shared with others to reduce the risk of ear infections. \n\t Should be disposed of once removed from the ear.\xc2\xa0 \n Reusable earplugs: \n\n \n Are either pre-molded, moldable, or custom fit. \n\t Have limited usage period.\xc2\xa0 \n\t Should be disposed of when they are cracked, dirty, no longer pliable, or permanently deformed.\xc2\xa0 \n Ear Muffs \n\n Ear muffs are designed to cover the ear and ear canal, so it is important to use muffs that are comfortable and fit properly. They can be used for years, and certain models can be used in combination with other safety equipment such as goggles, hard hat, or respiratory protection. Remember that hearing protection needs to be used whenever you are exposed to loud noises. \n\n When to Visit the Audiologist \n\n An audiologist can perform specialized hearing test called an audiogram to detect and diagnose hearing loss. You cannot fix hearing loss once it has started, but you can prevent the damage to your hearing from getting worse. The following are few signs that you may have problem with your hearing: \n\n \n You are turning up the volume on the TV or radio. \n\t You have difficulty understanding consonants in words and high notes of music. \n\t You have difficulty hearing person\xe2\x80\x99s voice when they are standing only few feet away. \n\t Sound may be muffled after noise is stopped. \n\t You have ringing in your ears. \n \xc2\xa0 \n\n \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n Use the following format to cite this article: \n\n Hearing loss and protection for agricultural producers.

(2012) Farm and Ranch eXtension in Safety and Health (FReSH) Community of Practice. Retrieved from http://www.extension.org/pages/64391/livestock-trailer-safety .\xc2\xa0 \n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n Towing livestock trailer is common practice on most farms and ranches. Livestock trailers, also referred to as stock trailers, are used to move livestock between locations, haul show animals to county fairs, and transport animals to processing plants. \n\n To safely tow livestock trailer, your truck must be capable of towing the weight of the trailer plus the added weight of the livestock. Check with the manufacturer to determine the Gross Combined Vehicle Weight (GCVW), which includes the tow vehicle\'s weight plus the loaded trailer weight. The GCVW rating can be located in the vehicle\'s serial number or in the operator\'s manual. When calculating the weight, remember to include the weight for fuel, passengers, and cargo. \n\n The manual for the trailer should specify maximum tongue weight \xe2\x80\x94the amount of the trailer\'s weight that presses down on the truck\'s trailer hitch when using bumper pull trailer or the truck\'s bed when using gooseneck trailer The majority of the weight (85% to 90%) should be carried over the axles so that only 10% to 15% of the weight is carried on the tongue. \n\n Before using livestock trailer, check both the truck and the trailer to ensure that they are in good working condition. In addition,\xc2\xa0take the following actions: \n\n \n \n Latches and safety chains: Double check the latches and the safety chains and cables between the truck and trailer to make sure they are fastened\xc2\xa0securely.\xc2\xa0Make sure you are using a\xc2\xa0ball that is the correct size for the trailer. \n\t \n Trailer brakes: Inspect the breakaway cable or brake system. Manufacturers recommend that any trailer exceeding\xc2\xa01,000 lb. have its own brake system, but you should also check\xc2\xa0state regulations regarding brake system requirements. \n\t \n Wheel bearings: Repack the wheel bearings on regular basis and replace as necessary. \n\t \n Electric Wiring and Connections: \xc2\xa0Make sure\xc2\xa0all wiring is in good condition. Trailer connectors should match the truck connectors. Check to make sure that all\xc2\xa0the lights (brake light, turn signals, and tail lights) on both the truck and the trailer\xc2\xa0are working.\xc2\xa0Make sure the electrical connection is securely plugged into the truck. \n\t \n Tires: Examine the tires for signs of dry rot, wear, or damage, and make sure that all tires, including the spare and inside dual tires, have the correct air pressure. Consider replacing tires at least every five years, regardless of use. \n\t \n Lug nuts: Inspect the lug nuts regularly to ensure they are properly tightened. \n\t \n Trailer: Inspect the trailer floor to make sure it is sturdy and clean. If more traction is needed, install rubber matting. Consider replacing floor boards that are showing signs of wear or rot. \n\t \n Battery: If you use battery-powered accessories, ensure that your emergency battery is charged and ready for use. \n\t \n Brake controllers: Test your brake controllers and make adjustments as needed depending on the weight of your trailer.\n\t\t \n The first step in testing your electric brakes is to locate the controller or adjustor, which is typically located beneath the instrument panel on the tow\xc2\xa0vehicle.\xc2\xa0The controller has an adjustment button (+ or -) and sliding lever. You may need to use the controller to increase braking power (+) for heavier loads\xc2\xa0or decrease braking power (-) for\xc2\xa0lighter loads. \n\t\t\t Once you have located the controller, slowly move forward on level surface and shift the tow vehicle transmission to neutral. Use the slide lever on the brake controller to bring the load to stop using the trailer brakes. \n\t\t\t If the trailer brakes cause the truck to jerk, your trailer brakes are adjusted too high. Lower the braking power on the trailer until the trailer comes to smooth stop. If the truck and loaded trailer do not slow to stop, the brake controller must be adjusted to higher level. \n\t\t \n \n Loading the Trailer \n\n Loading animals into trailer can sometimes be frustrating task, but there are steps you can take to make the task safer and, ideally, easier. For example, lower the back of the trailer as much as possible so that animals may step into the trailer without having to step up. Remember to be patient and calm during the loading process so that you do not scare or stress the animals. Additional recommendations include the following: \n\n \n \n Weight distribution: When using bumper pull trailer, place the heaviest animals in the front of the axles. Load older and larger animals first, followed by younger and smaller animals. \n\t \n Ties:\xc2\xa0 When tying animals in the trailer, use slip knots and tie securely at head height in the trailer. \n\t \n Visibility:\xc2\xa0 Make sure\xc2\xa0animals can see you when\xc2\xa0you enter and\xc2\xa0exit the trailer, when you are in the trailer,\xc2\xa0and when you tie or untie them. \n\t \n Squeeze and pinch points: Remain\xc2\xa0alert to the danger of\xc2\xa0being pinned between\xc2\xa0animals and trailer sides and being pinched by the trailer gate. \n\t \n Gates: Once the animals are loaded into the trailer, quickly close the gates and ensure that they are secure. \n\t \n Protrusions: Inspect the trailer for broken or sharp objects protruding into the trailer. These items should be repaired immediately to prevent an injury to an animal or operator. \n Traveling \n\n When driving on any roadway, always maintain safe speed, keep your headlights on, and stay alert. Your braking time increases when you are towing full trailer, so maintain safe distance from the vehicle in front of you and leave adequate room to stop. Plan your travel time carefully, and be aware that weather can cause delays by impacting road conditions and animal comfort. \n\n Do not lock the the trailer when you are transporting animals. In the event of an emergency, rescue workers will be able to more quickly gain access to an unlocked trailer. For your animals\xe2\x80\x99 safety, do not allow them to hang their heads out of the trailer, where they could be injured by flying objects. \n\n Resources \n\n View the video below about cattle trailer safety\xc2\xa0from Right from the Start: Safety Awareness for the Next Generation of Livestock Producers series from the Southwest Center for Agricultural Health, Injury Prevention, and Education. \n\n \n Video of Right from the Start-Cattle Trailers \n \n\n\n View the video below about horse trailer safety\xc2\xa0from Right from the Start: Safety Awareness for the Next Generation of Livestock Producer series from the Southwest Center for Agricultural Health, Injury Prevention, and Education. \n\n \n Video of Right from the Start-Horse Trailers \n \n\n\n For more information about cattle handling, click here to view the article\xc2\xa0""Beef Cattle Handling Safety."" \n\n \xc2\xa0\n\t Use the following format to cite this article: \n\n\t Livestock trailer safety.

Retrieved from http://articles.extension.org/pages/70904/overhead-power-line-safety \n\n Overhead power lines \xc2\xa0on farm or ranch can pose significant\xc2\xa0 electrocution hazard. Because power lines may have been installed without insulation or the insulation may have worn off due to exposure to weather, you should assume that all power lines are bare. Death from electrocution can occur when person touches power line while he or she is also in contact with the ground. When electricity enters something or someone, it takes the easiest and shortest path to electrical ground, the point at which the electricity is absorbed (as in the earth). \n\n There are numerous pieces of equipment on farm or ranch that, due to their height, can come in contact with overhead power lines: \n\n \n loader tractors\xc2\xa0 \n\t portable grain augers and elevators\xc2\xa0 \n\t dump trucks\xc2\xa0 \n\t \n cultivators in transport mode \n \n\t irrigation pipes\xc2\xa0 \n\t equipment with antennas\xc2\xa0 \n Specific Risks \n\n \n \n Dump trucks:\xc2\xa0 When raised, the\xc2\xa0bed of dump truck or trailer\xc2\xa0can contact\xc2\xa0overhead power lines. The person operating the\xc2\xa0dump\xc2\xa0truck\xc2\xa0should note\xc2\xa0the location of power lines before raising the bed\xc2\xa0and should\xc2\xa0not move the dump truck or trailer while the bed is in the raised position.\n\n\t\t \n Typically, if raised bed contacts a\xc2\xa0power line, the operator will not be at risk of electrocution if he or she remains\xc2\xa0inside\xc2\xa0the vehicle\xc2\xa0because the\xc2\xa0truck\xe2\x80\x99s tires provide insulation. If, however, person standing on the ground touches the dump truck or trailer while it is in contact with an overhead\xc2\xa0line, he or she could be electrocuted. \n \n\t\t \n \n \n \n Hay: \xc2\xa0A loader tractor or telescopic loader may be used during hay handling. Because the booms of such vehicles may reach as high as overhead power lines, putting the vehicle at risk of contact, hay should not be stored under\xc2\xa0power lines.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \n\t \n Grain bin:\xc2\xa0 Electrocution incidents associated with grain bins occur when augers and/or elevator equipment is used in the vicinity of overhead power lines. The National Electrical Safety Code (NESC) requires that, where portable auger or filling equipment is used,\xc2\xa0power lines be at least 18 ft. above the highest point on any grain bin constructed after 1992.\n\t\t \n Consult licensed electrician or your local power company for guidance when planning changes to your grain bin operations. \n\t\t\t Click here for diagram of\xc2\xa0clearance guidelines.\xc2\xa0 \n\t\t \n \n As farmer or rancher, you can reduce your risk of electrocution by following these recommendations: \n\n \n Be aware of the location of overhead power lines on your farm, and avoid the\xc2\xa0risk of electrocution by choosing route for your equipment that avoids potential contact. \n\t Never touch power line. \n\t Contact your local power company if an incident occurs. \n\t Never use ladders around power lines. \n\t Remember that some equipment may have higher profile during transport. \n\t Maintain 10 ft.\xc2\xa0clearance space between the power lines and your equipment. Contact your power company to determine the height of\xc2\xa0power lines on your farm. \n\t If you are in tractor and come in contact with\xc2\xa0power lines, remain in the tractor and have someone contact the power company to shut off the power.\n\t\t \n If you are in tractor that contacts\xc2\xa0power lines and you must exit because of\xc2\xa0an emergency such as fire, jump out and away from the tractor as far\xc2\xa0as possible. Never allow any part of your body to touch both the equipment and the ground at the same time. Plan to fall away from the tractor to avoid tripping back into contact with the tractor. \n\t\t \n \n\t Review\xc2\xa0safety measures with all individuals working on your farm, whether\xc2\xa0full-time, part-time, seasonal, or voluntary. \n\t Remember that even nonmetallic objects such as tree limbs, ropes, and straw can conduct electricity. \n Click HERE to view video from SafeElectricity.org which tells the story of Midwestern agricultural producer\'s death due to an electrical accident. \n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n \n\t Use the following format to cite this article: \n\n\t Overhead power-line safety.

In this session, Ray Nebel took look at some of the factors that affect reproduction on dairies, including labor, nutrition, environment, and the cow herself. He also discussed how you can find and fix problems that could be affecting the success of your reproduction program. \n\n \n\n The Role of Nutrition in Dairy Reproduction \n\n In this presentation, Dr. Milo Wiltbank discussed some studies on the effects nutrition can have on reproduction for high-efficiency dairy cattle. He talked about some important time periods to focus on, the effect of vitamin on reproductive performance, dry period nutrition and post-partum body condition, and more. \n\n \n\n Strategies to Improve Reproduction During Summer Heat Stress \n\n Reproductive failure is the number one reason dairy cows involuntarily leave the dairy farm and summer heat stress amplifies this costly issue. However, managerial, hormonal and novel reproductive technologies are available which will reduce the severity of summer heat stress on reproduction. The various strategies were presented in detail to educate both producers and consultants to be able to implement reproductive program changes to mitigate summer\xe2\x80\x99s negative effects. \n\n \n\n Economic Analysis Tools for Dairy Reproduction Programs \n\n Drs. Cabrera and Fricke of the University of Wisconsin-Madison have developed some new economic analysis tools for dairy reproduction programs. During this session, Dr. Cabrera discussed three main decision support systems, including the UW-DairyRepro$Plus and the Dairy Reproductive Economic Analysis. These tools are openly available at http://dairymgt.info/tools.php under the Reproduction heading. \n\n \n\n New Tools for Dairy Reproduction Programs \n\n Dr. Fricke covered two areas of reproductive research that have investigated new tools for reproduction and conclude each with an economic analysis of the data. The first new tool will be the use of accelerometer systems combined with various levels of synchronization for submitting cows for first AI service.

These systems allow for increased social facilitation among calves, redirection of labor from feeding to management of calves, consistency of milk delivery, and consumption of additional milk in smaller meals. Experience with these systems has revealed that the risk of spreading disease in the group housing can be minimized with good management, and non-nutritive sucking is minimized by the higher consumption of milk than is typical with conventional twice-a-day feeding. Some farmers have installed these systems with the idea that labor needs for calves would be reduced; however, use of these systems generally just allows redirection of the labor from feeding to calf management. Perceived benefits of such systems by dairy farmers considering adopting them need to be evaluated based on research and experiences by those using such systems. Thus, many aspects of AMF need to be monitored to optimize calf performance. \n\n Please check this link first if you are interested in organic or specialty dairy production \n\n Housing \n\n As with any indoor calf raising system, ventilation is fundamental for reducing the risk of respiratory and other diseases. Inadequate ventilation has been common problem in barns where AMF systems have been installed. Farmers should exercise caution when placing these feeders in pre-existing barns without modifications to the ventilation. Increased animal stocking density and inadequate ventilation can cause immediate issues and increase the incidence of respiratory diseases. Whether in pre-existing barn or new barn, positive pressure ventilation will most likely be needed. In University of Minnesota study, researchers observed that barns without such ventilation resulted in about an 80% increase in the likelihood that calves would become sick. \n\n minimum resting space of 35 sq. ft. per calf is needed, but 40 to 45 sq. ft. of space per calf is recommended, especially for larger breed calves. In the University of Minnesota study, health problems declined as the amount of space per calf was increased. From their study, they suggested 12 to 15 calves per pen because they observed that the number of sick calves increased with larger numbers of calves per pen. Most manufacturers of the AMF recommend one or two nipples per pen, with 25 to 30 calves per nipple. Thus to reduce the risk of disease, generally one nipple should be provided per pen and 20 to 25 calves grouped together. For example, 30\xe2\x80\x99 30\xe2\x80\x99 pen should provide enough space for 20 Holstein calves. However, it has often been observed that calves do not use the allocated space well; they tend to bunch up in certain areas of the pen. Improved use of entire pen can occur with good ventilation (most important), adequate amount of dry bedding, and placement of the water and calf starter away from the nipple. Both water and calf starter need to be provided free choice. The most common method of feeding calf starter is in raised bunk. Using the bunk tends to encourage calves to eat as group, thus potentially stimulating greater starter intake. \n\n Transition of Calves to AMF \n\n Calves should not be placed on the AMF immediately after birth. The essentials of dipping the navel and adequate colostrum feeding remain. In general, farmers have found the greatest success when calves are fed individually housed for to 14 days. During this time, they should be fed using nipple feeder (bottle or bucket) and can be moved to the AMF when they are healthy, have good suckling reflex, and drink all of their milk allowance. Moving calves to group housing too soon can increase health problems. When calves are moved to the AMF, timing within the day for moving the calf should be determined based on when they would be hungry (e.g., typical feeding time in individual housing). Then, they should be led to the feeding station and directly introduced to the nipple by the calf manager. \n\n Milk Allowance \n\n Once the calves have been moved to the AMF, they should be programmed to have to meals per day with meal sizes of 1.6 to 2.5 liters (0.42 to 0.66 gallons) at each meal; Holstein calves will easily consume 10 liters (2.6 gallons) per day. These systems are designed to use milk replacer, whole milk, or waste milk. Milk pasteurizers can be installed between the milk supply tank and the feeder when using whole or waste milk. The milk replacer should be mixed by the AMF to contain 13 to 15% solids. It is very important to get calves to their peak milk intake as soon as possible, starting them at to liters (1 to 1.5 gallons) and increasing to desired levels over three days. Weaning should be accomplished by reducing the number of meals to per day for days with 1.6 liters (0.4 gallons) per feeding. Additional information about weaning is available in the article \xe2\x80\x9c Weaning Calves from an Automatic Feeder \xe2\x80\x9d. \n\n Management Practices \n\n As mentioned previously, the labor for calves with AMF should change from that associated with calf feeding to being calf manager. This means that individuals managing AMF systems need to be well-trained to closely observe animals for early signs of illness and carefully monitor milk intake and speed of drinking. Morbidity, signs of dehydration (such as sunken eyes and skin tenting), labored breathing, and scours can be detected through visual observation. Number of meals, amount of milk allowance consumed, and drinking speed can also be monitored as indicators of illness. Using the information from the computer and walking the pens daily are fundamental to the success of AMF systems. Calves not performing well need immediate attention, and it is sometimes necessary to remove the calves from group housing until their health improves. Cross sucking should also be closely monitored, and the primary instigator may sometimes need to be removed from group housing. With the apparent greater non-nutritive sucking among Jersey than Holstein calves, there may be higher risk of cross suckling with Jersey calves. \n\n Monitoring the milk dispensing system for proper operation is critical. The calibration of the milk powder delivery needs to be checked according to the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations. Following the cleaning instructions and equipment repair and maintenance are also crucial for proper delivery of powder and keeping bacterial counts low. Bacterial counts have been found to be highly variable with AMF systems. In the University of Minnesota study, Standard Plate Counts with &gt; 100,000 cfu/mL were associated with greater incidence of health problems. Strict adherence to the water temperature and chemicals recommended for cleaning are essential for low bacterial counts and to prevent biofilm development on the surfaces with which milk comes in contact. The temperature of the water for mixing with the milk powder needs to be checked periodically. Inadequate mixing, improper water temperature for mixing and cleaning, and inadequate cleaning of the system all increase the risk for health issues among calves. \n\n In comparison to the conventional system of individually housing pre-weaned calves and feeding milk twice daily, AMF systems facilitate increased milk intake, allow social interaction among the calves, and allow labor to be focused on managing health and behavior of calves. The time which would be used for feeding calves with bottles or buckets and the associated time needed for mixing the milk and cleaning all the equipment in conventional feeding systems can instead be focused on calf management when using AMF. The interest in AMF systems for calves will likely continue to increase, and their use can result in efficient calf performance with minimal disease. However, with any calf feeding system, attention to details and early detection of disease are paramount. \n\n Author \n\n Maurice L.

Please check here to see other articles in this series. \n \n\n Gone are the days when growth and health of dairy calves are the only important outcomes expected with successful calf management programs! We now understand that these programs also impact calf\xe2\x80\x99s future performance. Known as perinatal programming, management and nutritional practices during early life have three to seven times more influence on future milk production than sire selection. Our understanding in this area has increased in recent years and this will continue to be an actively studied area. Consequently, the role of certain management practices which control or impact future performance will become better understood along with continual refinement of recommended nutritional and management practices in heifers prior to puberty. \xc2\xa0When implementing practices on farm, understanding the reasons behind these practices, why they have changed over time, and how they can impact future performance are important parts of managing heifer programs. \n\n Please check this link first if you are interested in organic or specialty dairy production \n\n Colostrum intake \n\n Feeding four quarts of high quality colostrum within six hours of life is important for healthy calves. Antibodies are not absorbed across the placenta because of the multiple tissue layers between the blood supply to the placenta and uterus. Thus, calves must absorb antibodies found in colostrum for early life immunity against diseases. Failure to absorb an adequate amount of IgG antibodies is known as failure of passive transfer. Calves which do not absorb adequate IgG antibodies have lower weight gain, increased risk for disease and death, and decreased milk production during their first lactation. (Additional information on feeding colostrum is available in the article \xe2\x80\x9c Getting Dairy Calves Off to Good Start \xe2\x80\x94 The SIP Principle with Colostrum\xe2\x80\x9d .) \n\n Colostrum important for more than healthy calves \n\n Researchers estimate that feeding four versus two quarts of colostrum to large breed calves may increase milk production by 2,500 lbs. or more during the first lactation. This production response is related to nutrients and other components found in colostrum, in addition to the antibodies. Colostrum contains growth factors, hormones and other biologically active factors which positively impact the development of the digestive tract. These components of colostrum, in turn, enhance the uptake and utilization of nutrients, especially those associated with providing energy. This positive effect continues throughout this calf\xe2\x80\x99s life. \n\n Calves are born with an immature immune system \n\n Newborns have an immature immune system which takes months or more to fully mature. Essentially, their immune system has \xe2\x80\x9cno memory\xe2\x80\x9d and, as result, does not respond well when faced with disease challenge. Maternal antibodies from colostrum are essential to protect the newborn for at least the first to months of life. However, these maternal antibodies can interfere with calf\xe2\x80\x99s ability to respond immunologically to traditionally administered vaccines. To avoid the influence of maternal antibodies, intranasal vaccines can be used to vaccinate young calves to reduce the risk of respiratory diseases. Intranasal vaccines elicit local immune response within the mucosa of the calf\xe2\x80\x99s nose and provide for quick immune response, thus providing disease protection for the calf.\xc2\xa0 These vaccines unfortunately only provide short term protection, usually less than 30 days. \n\n Pre-weaning growth rate impacts future milk yield \n\n majority of studies have shown that higher pre-weaning average daily gain positively impacts first-lactation milk yield. Scientists from Cornell University estimated that for each pound of daily gain, milk production increased by 1,540 lbs. in the first lactation or 6,000 lbs. over three lactations. They suggested that calves should double their birth weight by 56 days of life in order to achieve milk production responses from early life nutrition. In an analysis where many studies were evaluated, Gelsinger and others at Penn State University concluded that pre-weaned calves with average daily gains greater than 1.1 lbs./day have greater first-lactation milk yields. Obviously, appropriate growth post-weaning also is needed to capitalize on this improvement in milk production during the first lactation, and other management practices can impact performance later in life.\xc2\xa0 \n\n Calves born to heat-stressed dams absorb fewer antibodies \n\n Heat stress to the dam does not alter the concentration of IgG or antibodies in colostrum. However, calves born to heat-stressed dams absorb fewer antibodies, resulting in higher rates of failed passive transfer. Thus, reducing heat stress in dry cows impacts not only the body size of newborn calves, but also their potential health. \n\n Calves treated with antibiotics give less milk \n\n study showed no difference in first-lactation milk production between calves with or without diarrhea; however, scouring calves treated with antibiotics gave 1,086 lbs. less milk during their first-lactation than those not treated (Soberon and others 2012). These data do not indicate that antibiotics should not be used when needed, but that prolonged damage to the intestinal tract or other complications may occur. Besides scours, respiratory disease is common problem in calves. Dr. McGuirk (University of Wisconsin) estimates that three to four times more calves are affected with respiratory problems than are treated or identified by producers. Studies have shown decreased growth, decreased survival to first calving, and increased age at calving in calves with respiratory disease within the first 60 days following movement to group housing (Stanton and others, 2012).\xc2\xa0 Vaccines, minimizing stress, and providing proper ventilation in the microenvironment around the calf without causing drafts are important components in preventing respiratory illness. \n\n \xc2\xa0Author Information \n\n Donna M.

Metritis is an infectious disease that is typically observed 10 to 14 days after calving. Fresh cows with this infection have foul smelling discharge and may or may not have fever. Approximately 12% of freshening dairy cows experience some degree of metritis, with the incidence rate being greater in those that experience difficult birth, have twins, or have retained placenta. In DAIReXNET video entitled \xe2\x80\x9cDiagnosis and Treatment of Metritis in Dairy Cows\xe2\x80\x9d, Dr. Stephen LeBlanc from the University of Guelph discussed the factors that contribute to the occurrence of metritis, the impact of the disease, and treatment for it. summary of his discussion is included in this article. \n\n Please check this link first if you are interested in organic or specialty dairy production \n\n \n Dr. LeBlanc described metritis as foul smelling, reddish brown discharge from the vulva. He explained that only 10 to 45% of the cows with metritis have fever. \n\t After calving, all dairy cows experience some degree of bacterial contamination within the uterus and cow\xe2\x80\x99s immune system must \xe2\x80\x9ckick in\xe2\x80\x9d to clear the infection. Healthy cows have robust and well-regulated immune response that can respond to this contamination. Cows that later develop metritis may have lower or delayed immune response around the time of calving compared to cows that remain \xe2\x80\x9chealthy\xe2\x80\x9d. Thus, the difference between healthy cows and those which develop metritis is related to how effectively the cow responds to the infection and recovers.\xc2\xa0 \n\t \n E. coli is the initial bacterial contaminant associated with metritis. Certain strains of E. coli are adapted to cause an infection in the uterus, and these are different from those causing mastitis or scours in calves. \n\t Dr. LeBlanc discussed research that showed cows with metritis have lower milk production and reproductive performance. Mature cows with mild or severe case of metritis produce about 600 lbs. less milk within lactation compared to healthy fresh cows. First-calf heifers did not show any difference in milk production whether they had metritis or not. Cows with severe metritis had lower pregnancy rates at first service and by 120 days in milk, but these differences disappeared by 300 days in milk. Culling rates were not different between cows with or without metritis. \n\t Dr. LeBlanc discussed risk factors for metritis other than dystocia, twins, or retained placenta. Research has indicated relationship between feed intake before calving and risk for metritis. Cows that later develop metritis had lower dry matter intakes pre-calving than cows that did not develop metritis. Management practices, such as adequate bunk space (36 inches/cow), adequate resting space (80% of capacity), and heat abatement, are important to optimize feed intake before calving. In addition, subclinical hypocalemia (milk fever) can be risk factor for developing metritis. Calcium is important for uterine muscle contractions and for the best immune response to fight off bacterial challenges. \n\t Dr. LeBlanc also discussed the results of research studies where antibiotics were given as treatment for metritis. In one study, only three-quarters of the cows treated with an antibiotic were cured to days after treatment. For those cows not treated (saline only), 55 to 62% of the cows were cured. In another study, cure rates by 12 days were approximately 67% of cows treated. These data suggest that more studies are needed to refine and develop better treatment protocols and to determine when cows will likely respond to antibiotic treatment. \n\t In summarizing treatments for metritis, Dr. LeBlanc suggested that reasonable evidence exists for using systemic and approved antibiotics as directed on the product label when at least diagnostic criteria were present. These criteria include fever greater than 103\xc2\xb0F, fetid discharge, or other symptoms of systemic infection, such as dullness or being off-feed. As always, treatment options should be discussed with your herd veterinarian and treatment protocol developed for particular dairy herd. \n Author Information \n\n Donna M.

Will you raise your own heifers or contract them out? How will you manage nutrition, breeding, health, and even mastitis control? In this selection of DAIReXNET videos, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find information on range of calf and heifer topics, including economics, nutrition, and health management. \n\n Please check this link first if you are interested in organic or specialty dairy production \n\n Avoiding Disease in Dairy Calves \n\n Attention to health is particularly important for young calves, which are vulnerable to number of conditions. As the old adage goes, an ounce of prevention is worth pound of cure, so watch this video to learn about best practices for disease prevention! Here, Dr. Geof Smith focuses on environmental controls and early disease detection. \n\n \n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n Critical Economic Decisions when Raising Heifers \n\n Not sure of all the factors you should consider when making heifer-raising decisions? Jason Karszes lays them out for you in this video. He talks about the costs involved, factors that could influence those costs, and how the replacement program can affect the farm\xe2\x80\x99s overall financial performance. \n\n \n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n Economic Considerations Regarding the Raising of Dairy Replacement Heifers \n\n Diving little deeper into heifer economics, Dr. Mike Overton joins us to focus on the differences in conventional and intensive heifer raising systems. He discusses the inputs in different stages of growth, compares models, and talks little bit about the impact that heifer-rearing can have on later lactation. \n\n \n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n Meeting Heifer Nutrition Goals \n\n It can be difficult to keep an efficient and effective heifer nutrition program. Watch this video to learn about optimizing pre- and post-weaning growth and achieving puberty at the desired age. \n\n \n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n Feeding Systems for Group Housed Calves \n\n Speaking of nutrition, how do you get it into them in the first place? In this last video, Dr. Mark Thomas discusses feeding systems for group-housed dairy calves.

During the 2016/17 school year, Registered Dietitian and FNS Specialist Yvonne Potsko and FNS Director Laura Holmedal implemented district-wide Smarter Lunchrooms initiative that resulted in greater excitement about eating healthy foods and increased consumption of fruits and vegetables. \n\n The initiative began when the Martin County FNS team identified problem needing solution: students weren\xe2\x80\x99t selecting fruits and veggies and many were being thrown away. Mrs. Holmedal and Mrs. Potsko created an action plan for elementary schools that targeted fresh fruit and vegetable offerings with select Smarter Lunchroom strategies and food art techniques. \n\n To start, they engaged the UF/IFAS Extension Family Nutrition Program (SNAP-Ed in Florida) to conduct Smarter Lunchrooms training for 22 cafeteria and FNS staff in October 2016. The training provided an overview of the Smarter Lunchrooms Movement and outlined specific, research-based strategies that can \xe2\x80\x9cnudge\xe2\x80\x9d students toward making healthier food choices in the lunchroom. The training was crucial step in motivating cafeteria managers to take part in district-wide Smarter Lunchrooms initiative. \n\n Next, the FNS department provided cafeteria managers at the elementary level with inexpensive resources and tools to implement variety of creative marketing strategies that would make selecting fruits and veggies the easy and fun choice. These low- and no-cost tools included: \n\n \n \n Online Food Art Photos to give the managers ideas of how to creatively display fruits and veggies in enticing ways. \n\t \n Food-edible Markers to draw attractive designs on fruit, including bananas and oranges. Some fun designs that managers used were smiley faces, cartoon characters, hearts (great for Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s day), and jack o\xe2\x80\x99 lantern faces on oranges for Halloween. The result of this initiative was that students began seeking out produce with food art and requested them by name: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are the Minions bananas today?\xe2\x80\x9d \n \n\t \n Mini Cookie Cutters: to cut fruit into fun shapes for \xe2\x80\x9cmagical fruit salad.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\t \n Pre-printed Food labels for fruits and veggies label holders Mrs. Potsko pre-printed and laminated food labels with creative and fun names such as \xe2\x80\x9cBouncy Bananas,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMagically Mixed Fruit,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cO\xe2\x80\x99some Orange Slices.\xe2\x80\x9d The pre-printed labels took the guesswork and prep-work out of the process and made implementation of this strategy exceedingly simple for managers. \n\t \n Assorted Stickers to place on fruits and veggies. The stickers became collectibles in the school! \n\t \n Garnishes cherries and whipped cream made the cut fruit options look extra tasty. \n The district\xe2\x80\x99s efforts paid off! An analysis was conducted at one of the school sites that compared the amount of fresh produce sold the week before implementation to the week of the implementation. The analysis found an average increase of 62.8% for fruit and 13.8% for vegetables the week when the Smarter Lunchroom Strategies were in place. Additionally, district-wide elementary lunch participation increased by 6% and staff observed decrease in plate waste \n\n These exciting results culminated in USDA Annual Best Practices Award, which rewards outstanding practices in School Food Service Authorities and Schools! (School Food Service officials should contact their USDA state office for information on how to apply.) Martin County FNS will be expanding their Smarter Lunchroom program to middle and high schools during the 2017/2018 school year. \n\n By following Martin County\xe2\x80\x99s example, school districts, SNAP-Ed agencies, and partner organizations in any locale can collaborate to champion successful Smarter Lunchrooms Movement.

During lunchtime, each student was offered one slice of each variety, and asked to vote on their favorite. While students liked both apples, the Golden Supreme earned slightly more votes than the Ruby Mac, landing it in first place as the tasting winner. \xc2\xa0 \n\n This apple tasting was the first of four cafeteria tasting events at the school throughout the year, and was kickoff event for the school\xe2\x80\x99s new Smarter Lunchroom program. The date was chosen to coincide with Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s Homegrown School lunch week, an annual event in September when all public schools in Maryland feature locally-grown items on the school lunch menu to celebrate the statewide Farm to School program. \n\n \n\n During the tasting, students were also given Farmer Trading cards that highlight local farmers. These cards were provided by the Montgomery County Office of Agriculture and feature area farms that participate in the annual Montgomery County Farm Tour. Representatives from Montgomery County Public Schools, the Maryland Department of Agriculture, and the Maryland State Department of Education also joined in the fun, and shared photos on social media to celebrate the event. Students, teachers, and special guests enjoyed the tasting, and finished the day with extra enthusiasm for Maryland apples, and for Maryland farmers.\xc2\xa0 \n\n To learn more about your state\xe2\x80\x99s Farm to School program, visit the National Farm to School Network \n\n To learn more about Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s Homegrown School Lunch Week, visit the Maryland Department of Agriculture\xe2\x80\x99s Farm to School website. \n\n For more info on the Smarter Lunchroom program, visit the national Smarter Lunchroom website.\xc2\xa0 \n\n Contributor \n\n Joi Vogin, MS, CNS, LDN, University of Maryland Extension \n\n Header Photo: \xe2\x80\x9cApples, apples, apples\xe2\x80\x9d by James Cridland is licensed under CC BY 2.0 \n \n\t\t \n\n\t\t Back to Top \n\t\t \n \t\t \n \t\t\t Browse related by Tag \n \n healthy food choices in schools food service directors in the lunchroom smarter lunchrooms movement farm to school family and consumer sciences encourage kids to eat healthy food taste testing \n \n \t\t \n \t\t \n \t\t\t Share this post \n \t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n \t\t\t \n \t\t\t \n \t\t\t\t Have Question? \n \t\t\t\t Try asking one of our Experts \n \t\t\t \n \t\t \n\t\t \n\n \n\n \n \n \n Connect with us \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n Welcome \n This is where you can find research-based information from America\'s land-grant universities enabled by eXtension.org \n\n\n \n \n \n Select different institution \n \n \n LOCATE \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n Resources \n Welcome!

Some children may have access to food at home, but many children do not, prompting the need for the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) The SFSP provides free and nutritious meals to children 18 years of age and under in low-income areas during the summer. Adult family members can also eat nutritious meal with their children for low price. \n\n SFSP is funded by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and administered by state agencies, such as the state department of education or department of agriculture. These state agencies monitor the SFSP sponsors and sites and communicate with the USDA regarding regulations. \xc2\xa0A sponsor is an organization, such as school district or non-profit community organization. They must be able to responsibly operate, support, and oversee finances of food service program. The sponsors must complete SFSP training and apply to serve free meals under the SFSP. To ensure children are receiving healthy meals, sponsors must follow the SFSP meal patterns and requirements established by the USDA. Milk, grains, fruits and vegetables, and meat or meat alternate must be presented at each site. Sponsors operate one or more sites, the physical locations where meals are served. Popular sites include schools, recreation centers, community parks, and water parks.\xc2\xa0 Families can find nearby sites through social media ads, calling the National Hunger Hotline, or using the Kids Food Finder Map \n\n The bright red El Fuego food truck in Greeley, Colorado demonstrates how sponsor can go above and beyond serving healthy meals by providing outreach, access, and service. During the school year, the truck serves street tacos and other healthy options that meet the National School Lunch Program guidelines. During the summer, the meals typically include sandwich, vegetable, fruit, and milk. The meals are prepped ahead of time and packaged in colorful, kid-friendly bags. The food truck buzzes around town for both breakfast and lunch, stopping at seven different sites. El Fuego staff are passionate about their service. They encourage the kids to come back each day for meal and keep them company while they enjoy their food on site. The staff make it point to park in front of the popular gas stations and other busy locations to guide the children towards healthier food option. These best practices can be adopted by sponsors in other locations. \n\n The SFSP plays an imperative role in the quest to provide proper nutrition to children year-round. The USDA Summer Food Service Program website provides additional resources to learn more about this program in your state. \n\n Contributors \n\n Sammie Springsteen, University of Northern Colorado \n\n Jonathan Padia, Office of School Nutrition, Colorado Department of Ed. \n\n Photo \xc2\xa0by\xc2\xa0 usdagov \xc2\xa0/ CC BY\xc2\xa0 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/ \n \n\t\t \n\n\t\t Back to Top \n\t\t \n \t\t \n \t\t\t Browse related by Tag \n \n meals at home healthy food choices in schools encourage kids to eat healthy foods summer feeding programs \n \n \t\t \n \t\t \n \t\t\t Share this post \n \t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n \t\t\t \n \t\t\t \n \t\t\t\t Have Question? \n \t\t\t\t Try asking one of our Experts \n \t\t\t \n \t\t \n\t\t \n\n \n\n \n \n \n Connect with us \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n Welcome \n This is where you can find research-based information from America\'s land-grant universities enabled by eXtension.org \n\n\n \n \n \n Select different institution \n \n \n LOCATE \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n Resources \n Welcome!

The purpose of this grant was to provide school children with access to healthy meals where they live, learn, and play 365 days year demonstrating childhood hunger can be eliminated. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The grant is posed to improve student achievement and behavior, showing that when students are well nourished, they are ready to learn. \n\n Partnership is crucial for executing and implementing this two-year demo grant. Major partners are USDA, Virginia Foundation for Healthy Youth, Share Our Strength, Feeding America, the Southeast United Dairy Association, Virginia Department of Health, First Lady of Virginia-Dorothy McAuliffe, and Virginia Cooperative Extension (VCE). Federal dollars from VCE Family Nutrition Program (FNP) are from Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program-Education (SNAP-Ed) and the Expanded Nutrition Education Nutrition Program (EFNEP) funds. FNP\xe2\x80\x99s mission is to teach limited-resource families and youth how to make healthier food choices and become better managers of available food resources for optimal health and growth. Thus, the mission of this grant makes FNP needed partner as trained nutrition paraprofessionals can provide parents of school children the knowledge and skills to improve food management food skills, and at home nutrition practices.\xc2\xa0 \n\n For the project, trained VCE FNP paraprofessionals provided six lessons from the peer reviewed, evidence-based Eat Smart, Be Active curriculum along with food preparation and cooking skills. Paraprofessionals provide lessons to parents at the participating \xc2\xa0 test school. \xc2\xa0 Control schools were selected in the same city or county as the test school and shared similar demographics and characteristics as the test schools, but they did not receive the 365 Project resources. All schools were in rural Southwest Virginia (the counties of Buchanan, Grayson, Lee, Scott, Smyth, and cities of Galax and Bristol) and the City of Richmond. Each of these locations have high poverty rate, and free/reduced lunch rates that are at 55% or higher. \n\n In addition to providing nutrition education to parents, the grant provides funding to provide school children three meals to eat at school. Breakfast is often Grab and Go bag or Breakfast in the Classroom. In addition to free breakfast and lunch, school children eat dinner meal prior to leaving school. The regional food bank provides and stores foods for the backpacks that provide food to children on the weekends and during school breaks such as holiday break. During the months of June, July, and August, parents of school children receive additional SNAP-Ed benefits from the Virginia Department of Social Services to help feed their children more adequately. \n\n An outside evaluation company, Mathematica, assesses the test school children\xe2\x80\x99s academic achievement factors, overall behavior and disciplinary changes, absentee rate, health indices, and other factors compared to control schools and pre intervention data. While the demo grant\xe2\x80\x99s results are not complete, the VCE FNP has compiled results on nutrition behavior of school children\xe2\x80\x99s parents completing the six FNP lessons. Upon completion of lessons, 100% of FNP participants showed improvement in one or more nutrition practices (i.e. plans meals, makes healthy food choices, prepares food without adding salt, reads nutrition labels or has children eat breakfast). One hundred percent of FNP participants showed improvement in one or more objectives related to management of food resource practices (i.e. plan meals, compare prices, does not run out of food or uses grocery lists). \n\n With the first year of grant implementation, FNP and grant administrators learned some valuable \xe2\x80\x9clessons\xe2\x80\x9d. These were: \n\n \n Solicit school principal and community buy-in\xc2\xa0 \n\t Recognize principals for their support\xc2\xa0 \n\t Promote FNC lessons at outside school events in rural communities where community buy-in is essential \n\t Schedule FNP classes at the times when school principals believe parents will attend \n\t Publish class schedules on DOE and VCE websites \n\t Hold programs at school field days and back to school events \n\t Test system for class reminders (text, Facebook, email, etc.) to recruit FNP participants \n This year (2017), Project 365 has established mini-grants to support the efforts of participating school divisions in promoting the VA 365 Project, engaging families and community partners in outreach activities, and sharing resource information. The mini-grants support back-to-school activities, volunteer recognition events, and other outreach efforts that benefit the participating schools. In addition, the grant monies provide cookware set to each FNP participant that complete six lessons and accompanying activities. With using this educational incentive, Project 365 plans to increase parent enrollment and FNP lesson completion.\xc2\xa0 \n\n Contributor \n\n Mary Ann McFarland, Virginia Tech, Virginia Cooperative Extension \n\n Sources &amp; Resources\xc2\xa0 \n\n Virginia Project 365.

Mindful eating refers to paying attention to the present moment when choosing, preparing, and eating food. Mindful eating can strengthen attention to food-elicited cues and decrease emotional eating due to negative emotions. Research suggests that mindful eating interventions may be associated with reduced food cravings, emotional eating, and binge-eating episodes, as well as improved health outcomes such as BMI and blood glucose levels. The primary goal of the Foodie project was to develop and pilot-test strategies based on mindful eating practices for fostering healthy food-related behaviors among elementary-school children and families.\xc2\xa0 The workbook was pilot-tested with rd through th graders and their parents who were primarily Hispanic and non-Hispanic white. Nutrition educators taught six, once-a-month mindful eating lessons in the classroom and take-home activities were provided to promote the practice of mindful eating at home with parents or guardians. The workbook was modified and finalized based on feedback from children, parents and teachers, as well as suggestions from eXtension experts. \n\n This workbook is primarily for educators who are interested in promoting healthy eating behaviors to children and families through mindful eating practices. It contains the following six lessons, each of which includes classroom activities for students and take-home activities for families: \n\n Lesson 1: Master Mindless Munching \xc2\xa0 \n\n Students will learn at least three ways to minimize the effects of environmental cues on their consumption of food and beverages at home. \n\n Lesson 2: Sensational Senses \n\n Students will practice present-centered awareness by noticing and describing the sensory observations of food and eating with curiosity and without judgments related to preferences. \n\n Lesson 3: Getting to Know Hunger and Fullness \n\n Students will learn how to listen to their body to notice their hunger level helps us decide when to start and stop eating \n\n Lesson 4: Emotions Inside Out \n\n Students will practice becoming aware of their thoughts and emotions as they relate to physical hunger and making balanced choices about food. \n\n Lesson 5: Planting Seeds of Mindfulness \n\n Students will increase awareness of the time and energy that goes into the food they eat before it reaches the plate. \n\n Lesson 6: Cultural Celebration Feast \n\n \xe2\x80\x8bStudents will prepare and eat meal mindfully and engage in community-building discussions with their peers, teachers, and family. \n\n Additionally, this workbook includes materials such as handouts and take-home activities in Spanish. The authors encourage educators across the nation to modify the activities of the workbook based on their needs and interests. \n\n Preliminary project evaluation results [i] suggest that mindful eating interventions may help increase mindful eating practices (awareness) and the consumption of healthful foods, as well as reducing food craving among children.\xc2\xa0 The authors sincerely hope this workbook is helpful in making positive changes in food behaviors and wellbeing of children and families!\xc2\xa0 For more information about Foodie please contact Keiko Goto at kgoto@csuchico.edu \xc2\xa0This project was funded by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture -Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) program. \n\n Download the full PDF workbook here:\xc2\xa0 Foodie U: Mindful Eating for Families \n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n \n\n \n Contributors \n\n Shannon Pierson, MS,\xc2\xa0California State University, Chico \n\n Joan Giampaoli PhD, RD, California State University, Chico \n\n Keiko Goto, PhD,\xc2\xa0California State University, Chico \n\n Alyson Wylie, MA, California State University, Chico \n\n Ben Seipel PhD, California State University, Chico \n\n Source \n\n \n\t \n\t\t [i] Pierson S, Goto K, Giampaoli J, Wylie A.

Please check here to see other articles in this series. \n \n\n Introduction \n\n Commercially affordable sexed semen (since 2006) and genomic testing (since 2009) have added to the options that dairy farmers should consider when looking to increase profitability. These technologies, combined with good overall management, and older technologies such as embryo transfer or beef semen, lead to an expanded number of choices regarding genetic selection, breeding and culling. Among the options to consider are: \n\n \n which animals to breed \xc2\xa0with sexed semen, \n\t which dairy calves to raise as herd replacements, \n\t which cows to cull, \n\t possible use of beef semen to create crossbred calves, and \n\t whether to use genomic testing. \n The best combination of these practices is often not obvious. This article lays out some of the key principles behind finding these best combinations and discuss results of some combinations that lead to greater profitability. \n\n Please check this link first if you are interested in organic or specialty dairy production \n\n Genetics and Genomic Testing 101 \n\n Genomic testing provides more reliable estimates of the genetic merit of animals than estimates that are only based on the animal\xe2\x80\x99s relatives, and testing can be performed at young age. The parent averages or predicted transmitting abilities (PTA) of the various traits on the genomic test report are the genetic merits that the animal is expected (predicted) to transmit to its offspring (the next generation). The expected genetic merit of the animal itself is the estimated breeding value (EBV), which is PTA EBV. The EBV of Lifetime Net Merit (NM$) differences between animals provide direct estimates of the differences in profit when exploring the economics of genomic testing and breeding decisions. Differences in PTA of NM$ only show half of the profit differences between animals. For example, if two animals have PTA of NM$ of +$300 and +$400, then the difference in lifetime profit is expected to be $200. PTA are expected values of genetic merit but the true genetic merit can be quite different. Genomic testing provides PTA that are on average more similar to the true genetic merit of animals. \n\n How to Evaluate Breeding Schemes \n\n At the University of Florida, we put together herd budget model to evaluate combinations of genomic usages, semen type, and culling rates given herd specific data and prices. The bottom line is to focus on profit per milking cow per year. In this model, dairy calves kept as replacements were valued based on their genetic merit. This genetic merit depends on the genetic merit of the dams and sires of the calves and on the sale value of the surplus heifer calves. greater surplus of dairy calves can be created with sexed semen, but this is at higher cost than using conventional semen and at lower conception rates. Sexed, conventional, and beef semen can be applied to different groups of cattle. Results of some user-defined and optimal breeding schemes are shown in this article. \n\n The cost of genomic testing was set at $50 per tested calf, which included the extra labor cost for obtaining and sending the sample. All born alive dairy calves were tested if genomic testing was applied. Culled cows were sold at approximately half the cost of raising heifers. Dairy bull calves and surplus dairy heifer calves were sold one month after birth at profit of $150 after their expenses. The initial premium for crossbred calf was $75 over the price of dairy bull calf. Many other inputs that affect the outcomes are not shown here but certainly affect the outcomes from the model. The cow cull rate was fixed at 35% and did not vary with breeding scheme. \n\n Optimal Breeding Schemes \n\n The best breeding scheme generates the greatest profitability. This means finding the optimal combinations of semen type (sexed, conventional, or beef) per service number and per parity. The herd budget model can search for these best breeding schemes. constraint is that at least enough dairy heifer calves must be born to replace culled cows. \n\n Scheme #1: Changing premium for crossbred calves \n\n \n\n Figure . User-defined and optimal breeding schemes and profitability depending on the premiums paid for crossbred calves and the use of genomic testing or traditional genetic reliabilities. The top part has user-defined breeding scheme where the top 60% of heifers were bred with sexed semen (se). The bottom 50% of second parity and older cows were bred with beef semen (be). All other breedings in heifers and cows were with conventional semen (co). In the bottom part, no conventional semen is used although this was an option. Profit is expressed as per milking cow per year. \n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n Figure shows results from an analysis where the premium for crossbred calves was set at +$75, +$150 and +$225 over the sale price of purebred dairy bull calves. The top part has user-defined breeding scheme where the top 60% of heifers were bred with sexed semen (se). The bottom 50% of second parity and older cows were bred with beef semen (be). All other breedings in heifers and cows were with conventional semen (co). This scheme resulted in the occurrence of just enough dairy heifer calves to replace culled cows, but there was no surplus. \n\n Profit per milking cow per year increased with greater premium for crossbred calves as expected. Genomic testing resulted in loss of $5 per milking cow per year for all three example premiums. Genomic testing results were used to identify the top 60% heifers to breed with sexed semen, and the bottom 50% of older cows to breed with beef semen, but not for calf selection. \n\n The bottom part of Figure shows results for more profitable breeding schemes. The schemes depended on the premium of crossbred calves and use of more sexed semen. Conventional semen was not used at all. The schemes also depended little on whether genomic testing was used.. Profit per milking cow was increased by $13 to $81 compared to the user-defined scheme in the top part of Figure 1. The better breeding schemes were clearly more profitable than reasonable user-defined breeding scheme. Genomic testing now added additional value compared to relying on traditional genetic reliabilities, but the value decreased with the size of the premium for the crossbred calves. \n\n Scheme #2:\xc2\xa0 Effects of Pregnancy rates \n\n \n\n Figure 2. User-defined and optimal breeding schemes and profitability depending on pregnancy rates and the use of genomic testing or traditional genetic reliabilities. The top part has user-defined breeding scheme where the top 50% of heifers were bred with sexed semen (se). All other breedings in heifers and cows were with conventional semen (co). Beef semen (be) was not allowed to be used. Profit is expressed per milking cow per year. \n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n Figure shows the effect of greater pregnancy rates (\xe2\x89\x8814%, \xe2\x89\x8820%, and \xe2\x89\x8828%) on the profitability and optimal breeding schemes. The set-up was the same as in Figure 1. The user-defined breeding scheme was set with 50% sexed semen in the top heifers and conventional semen in all other animals. The conception rate of sexed semen was assumed to be 80% of the conception rate of conventional semen. Therefore, the pregnancy rates were changed about percentage point when more or less sexed semen was used. \n\n The user-defined schemes resulted in increases profitability with greater pregnancy rates, as might be expected. Genomic testing was not profitable when pregnancy rate was \xe2\x89\x8814% but generated $38 more profit per milking cow per year when pregnancy rate was \xe2\x89\x8828%. At the low pregnancy rate, no surplus calves were available so genomic testing results were only used to select the top 50% of heifers. At the high pregnancy rate, genomic testing was used to select the surplus calves (26% surplus when pregnancy rate was \xe2\x89\x8828%) and again to identify the top heifers to breed with sexed semen. There was clearly strong interaction between the value of genomic testing and cow pregnancy rate in the herd. \n\n The bottom part of Figure 2 shows again increases in profitability over the user-defined scheme in the same situation.\xc2\xa0 Genomic testing resulted in the use of more sexed semen. Genomic testing was profitable even at the lowest pregnancy rate in combination with the use of more sexed semen, which resulted in small surplus of dairy calves. At the highest pregnancy rate, genomic testing resulted in $57 increase in profit per milking cow per year compared to no genomic testing. \n\n The optimal breeding schemes were limited to the use of only sexed and conventional semen in Figure 2. Beef semen was not allowed to be used to help with better comparison with the user-defined scheme. This means that even better breeding schemes are possible when all three breeding types are available at these varying levels of pregnancy rates. \n\n Several pieces of the puzzle were not included in the results shown above. One value of genomic testing is the ability to correct parent misidentification errors. The value of correcting misidentification errors is generally too low by itself to warrant genomic testing, except perhaps to identify elite breeding stock. The analyses above also assumed fixed annual cull rate of 35% to avoid the complicated effects of more or less voluntary culling. Genetic progress in sires is double today from what it was years ago, meaning that heifers are genetically better than cows and incrementally more so than in the recent past. Few studies have investigated the direct effects of genetic improvement on optimal cull rates. Data from these studies allow us to conclude that the economic optimal cull rates continue to depend more on cow depreciation than on accelerated genetic improvement in heifers, but culling should be increased by few percentage units with improvement in the genetic merit of heifer calves born on the farm. \n\n Take Home Messages \n\n \n Genomic testing of females on the farm can be profitable, depending on the fraction of surplus heifers available and smart breeding decisions regarding the use of sexed and beef semen. \n\t Better reproduction makes innovative breeding schemes more profitable. \n\t The opportunity cost of not using innovating breeding schemes is greater than decade ago. \n\t Seek professional help to discover and implement an innovative breeding scheme that combines components of genomics, various semen types, and voluntary culling while protecting the farm\xe2\x80\x99s risk. \n Author Information \n\n Albert DeVries \n\tProfessor, Department of Animal Sciences \n\tUniversity of Florida \n\n Acknowledgment \n\n The model development and analyses in this study were financially supported by USDA NIFA AFRI grant award 2013-68004-20365 titled \xe2\x80\x9cImproving Fertility of Dairy Cattle Using Translational Genomics\xe2\x80\x9d. \n \n\t\t \n\n\t\t Back to Top \n\t\t \n \t\t \n \t\t\t Browse related by Tag \n \n dairy cattle dairy cattle:genetics \n \n \t\t \n \t\t \n \t\t\t Share this post \n \t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n \t\t\t \n \t\t\t \n \t\t\t\t Have Question? \n \t\t\t\t Try asking one of our Experts \n \t\t\t \n \t\t \n\t\t \n\n \n\n \n \n \n Connect with us \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n Welcome \n This is where you can find research-based information from America\'s land-grant universities enabled by eXtension.org \n\n\n \n \n \n Select different institution \n \n \n LOCATE \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n Resources \n Take look at our series of new articles written just for DAIReXNET! \n\n Sign Up for Our Newsletter \n\n Videos \n\n \n Dairy Video Archive \n\t Upcoming Dairy Videos \n Subject Areas \n\n \n Business Management and Farm Labor \n\t Calf and Heifer Management \n\t Facilities \n\t Food Safety \n\t Genetics \n\t Health and Diseases \n\t Mastitis and Milking Management \n\t Materiales en espa\xc3\xb1ol \n\t Milk Marketing \n\t Nutrient Management for Dairies \n\t Nutrition of Milking and Dry Cows \n\t Reproduction \n Other Resources \n\n \n State Newsletters \n\t State Extension Websites \n\t Consumer Links \n\t Contributing Partners \n \n \n \n\n \n \n This work is supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, New Technologies for Ag Extension project. \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n \n View publishing information about this page. \n \n\n\n \n\n \n \n Resource Areas \n Community \n \n Agricultural and Food Law \n Civil Dialogue \n Community Planning and Zoning \n Community, Local and Regional Food Systems \n Cooperatives \n Creating Healthy Communities \n Diversity, Equity and Inclusion \n Enhancing Rural Community Capacity \n Entrepreneurs &amp; Their Communities \n Geospatial Technology \n Internationalizing Extension \n Network Literacy \n Program Evaluation \n Volunteer Administration \n Women in Agriculture \n \n Disaster Issues \n \n Agricultural Disaster Preparedness and Recovery \n Drought Resources \n Floods \n Wildfire \n \n \n \n Energy \n \n Farm Energy \n Home Energy \n Wood Energy \n \n Environment \n \n Prescribed Fire \n Trees for Energy Conservation \n \n Family \n \n Child and Family Learning Network \n Child Care \n Companion Animals \n Drinking Water and Human Health \n Family Caregiving \n Food Safety \n Military Families \n Parenting \n Personal Finance \n \n \n \n Farm \n \n Ag Safety and Health \n Animal Manure Management \n Animal Welfare \n Apples \n Bee Health \n Beef Cattle \n Blueberries \n Climate, Forests and Woodlands \n Dairy \n Forest Farming \n Freshwater Aquaculture \n Goats \n Grapes \n Horses \n Marine Aquaculture \n Organic Agriculture \n Plant Breeding and Genomics \n Sheep \n Small and Backyard Flocks \n Small Meat Processors \n Sustainable Marine Fisheries \n Wood Products \n \n \n \n Health and Nutrition \n \n Community Nutrition Education \n Families, Food and Fitness \n Healthy Food Choices in Schools \n \n Lawn and Garden \n \n Extension Master Gardener \n Gardens &amp; Landscapes \n The Garden Professors \n Water Conservation for Lawn and Landscape \n \n Pest Management \n \n Ant Pests \n Feral Hogs \n Imported Fire Ants \n Invasive Species \n Pest Management In and Around Structures \n Wildlife Damage Management \n \n Youth \n \n Ag Zone \n Science for Youth \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Feeds \n eXtension Members \n Privacy \n Contact Us \n Terms of Use \n \n &copy; 2017 eXtension.

Please check here to see other articles in this series. \n \n\n Introduction \n\n Commercially affordable sexed semen (since 2006) and genomic testing (since 2009) have added to the options that dairy farmers should consider when looking to increase profitability. These technologies, combined with good overall management, and older technologies such as embryo transfer or beef semen, lead to an expanded number of choices regarding genetic selection, breeding and culling. Among the options to consider are: \n\n \n which animals to breed \xc2\xa0with sexed semen, \n\t which dairy calves to raise as herd replacements, \n\t which cows to cull, \n\t possible use of beef semen to create crossbred calves, and \n\t whether to use genomic testing. \n The best combination of these practices is often not obvious. This article lays out some of the key principles behind finding these best combinations and discuss results of some combinations that lead to greater profitability. \n\n Please check this link first if you are interested in organic or specialty dairy production \n\n Genetics and Genomic Testing 101 \n\n Genomic testing provides more reliable estimates of the genetic merit of animals than estimates that are only based on the animal\xe2\x80\x99s relatives, and testing can be performed at young age. The parent averages or predicted transmitting abilities (PTA) of the various traits on the genomic test report are the genetic merits that the animal is expected (predicted) to transmit to its offspring (the next generation). The expected genetic merit of the animal itself is the estimated breeding value (EBV), which is PTA EBV. The EBV of Lifetime Net Merit (NM$) differences between animals provide direct estimates of the differences in profit when exploring the economics of genomic testing and breeding decisions. Differences in PTA of NM$ only show half of the profit differences between animals. For example, if two animals have PTA of NM$ of +$300 and +$400, then the difference in lifetime profit is expected to be $200. PTA are expected values of genetic merit but the true genetic merit can be quite different. Genomic testing provides PTA that are on average more similar to the true genetic merit of animals. \n\n How to Evaluate Breeding Schemes \n\n At the University of Florida, we put together herd budget model to evaluate combinations of genomic usages, semen type, and culling rates given herd specific data and prices. The bottom line is to focus on profit per milking cow per year. In this model, dairy calves kept as replacements were valued based on their genetic merit. This genetic merit depends on the genetic merit of the dams and sires of the calves and on the sale value of the surplus heifer calves. greater surplus of dairy calves can be created with sexed semen, but this is at higher cost than using conventional semen and at lower conception rates. Sexed, conventional, and beef semen can be applied to different groups of cattle. Results of some user-defined and optimal breeding schemes are shown in this article. \n\n The cost of genomic testing was set at $50 per tested calf, which included the extra labor cost for obtaining and sending the sample. All born alive dairy calves were tested if genomic testing was applied. Culled cows were sold at approximately half the cost of raising heifers. Dairy bull calves and surplus dairy heifer calves were sold one month after birth at profit of $150 after their expenses. The initial premium for crossbred calf was $75 over the price of dairy bull calf. Many other inputs that affect the outcomes are not shown here but certainly affect the outcomes from the model. The cow cull rate was fixed at 35% and did not vary with breeding scheme. \n\n Optimal Breeding Schemes \n\n The best breeding scheme generates the greatest profitability. This means finding the optimal combinations of semen type (sexed, conventional, or beef) per service number and per parity. The herd budget model can search for these best breeding schemes. constraint is that at least enough dairy heifer calves must be born to replace culled cows. \n\n Scheme #1: Changing premium for crossbred calves \n\n \n\n Figure . User-defined and optimal breeding schemes and profitability depending on the premiums paid for crossbred calves and the use of genomic testing or traditional genetic reliabilities. The top part has user-defined breeding scheme where the top 60% of heifers were bred with sexed semen (se). The bottom 50% of second parity and older cows were bred with beef semen (be). All other breedings in heifers and cows were with conventional semen (co). In the bottom part, no conventional semen is used although this was an option. Profit is expressed as per milking cow per year. \n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n Figure shows results from an analysis where the premium for crossbred calves was set at +$75, +$150 and +$225 over the sale price of purebred dairy bull calves. The top part has user-defined breeding scheme where the top 60% of heifers were bred with sexed semen (se). The bottom 50% of second parity and older cows were bred with beef semen (be). All other breedings in heifers and cows were with conventional semen (co). This scheme resulted in the occurrence of just enough dairy heifer calves to replace culled cows, but there was no surplus. \n\n Profit per milking cow per year increased with greater premium for crossbred calves as expected. Genomic testing resulted in loss of $5 per milking cow per year for all three example premiums. Genomic testing results were used to identify the top 60% heifers to breed with sexed semen, and the bottom 50% of older cows to breed with beef semen, but not for calf selection. \n\n The bottom part of Figure shows results for more profitable breeding schemes. The schemes depended on the premium of crossbred calves and use of more sexed semen. Conventional semen was not used at all. The schemes also depended little on whether genomic testing was used.. Profit per milking cow was increased by $13 to $81 compared to the user-defined scheme in the top part of Figure 1. The better breeding schemes were clearly more profitable than reasonable user-defined breeding scheme. Genomic testing now added additional value compared to relying on traditional genetic reliabilities, but the value decreased with the size of the premium for the crossbred calves. \n\n Scheme #2:\xc2\xa0 Effects of Pregnancy rates \n\n \n\n Figure 2. User-defined and optimal breeding schemes and profitability depending on pregnancy rates and the use of genomic testing or traditional genetic reliabilities. The top part has user-defined breeding scheme where the top 50% of heifers were bred with sexed semen (se). All other breedings in heifers and cows were with conventional semen (co). Beef semen (be) was not allowed to be used. Profit is expressed per milking cow per year. \n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n Figure shows the effect of greater pregnancy rates (\xe2\x89\x8814%, \xe2\x89\x8820%, and \xe2\x89\x8828%) on the profitability and optimal breeding schemes. The set-up was the same as in Figure 1. The user-defined breeding scheme was set with 50% sexed semen in the top heifers and conventional semen in all other animals. The conception rate of sexed semen was assumed to be 80% of the conception rate of conventional semen. Therefore, the pregnancy rates were changed about percentage point when more or less sexed semen was used. \n\n The user-defined schemes resulted in increases profitability with greater pregnancy rates, as might be expected. Genomic testing was not profitable when pregnancy rate was \xe2\x89\x8814% but generated $38 more profit per milking cow per year when pregnancy rate was \xe2\x89\x8828%.

At the high pregnancy rate, genomic testing was used to select the surplus calves (26% surplus when pregnancy rate was \xe2\x89\x8828%) and again to identify the top heifers to breed with sexed semen. There was clearly strong interaction between the value of genomic testing and cow pregnancy rate in the herd. \n\n The bottom part of Figure 2 shows again increases in profitability over the user-defined scheme in the same situation.\xc2\xa0 Genomic testing resulted in the use of more sexed semen. Genomic testing was profitable even at the lowest pregnancy rate in combination with the use of more sexed semen, which resulted in small surplus of dairy calves.

While parents are encouraged to find ways to involve their children in meal preparation at home, many schools are incorporating cooking activities into their health, science and math curricula as way to promote healthy eating. \n\n There are several resources available to schools interested in incorporating cooking into school days or afterschool programming. Cooperative Extension and Cooking Matters may be great places to start. \n\n Cooking Matters is Share Our Strength program founded in 1993 and is part of the No Kid Hungry campaign, which is working to end childhood hunger in America. Through cooking classes and interactive grocery store tours, Cooking Matters partners teach families how to make the most of the food budget so that families prepare affordable, nutritious meals. \n\n Cooking Matters uses collaborative model designed to enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of the cooking classes. Educational materials, training, evaluation, and national leadership are provided by Share Our Strength. Local partners, such as Cooperative Extension, deliver the program to meet the needs of their communities. Cooking Matters partners may already exist in your area \n\n Cooperative Extension agencies in many states across the nation have thriving partnerships with Cooking Matters. Likewise, Cooperative Extension is an excellent resource and is well positioned to help bridge the gap between home and school and increase the impact of nutrition education by providing the same messages to children at school as is given to the parents and adults. \n\n Cooperative Extension educators may be able to come directly to classrooms and/or afterschool programs to provide nutrition lessons, food demonstrations, cooking opportunities, and tasting experiences. Cooperative Extension programs like SNAP-Education, Expanded Food Nutrition Education, and 4-H use research-based curricula for different age groups and grade levels. The lessons are interactive, connected to many of the common core and state standards, and fun!

While parents are encouraged to find ways to involve their children in meal preparation at home, many schools are incorporating cooking activities into their health, science and math curricula as way to promote healthy eating. \n\n There are several resources available to schools interested in incorporating cooking into school days or afterschool programming. Cooperative Extension and Cooking Matters may be great places to start. \n\n Cooking Matters is Share Our Strength program founded in 1993 and is part of the No Kid Hungry campaign, which is working to end childhood hunger in America. Through cooking classes and interactive grocery store tours, Cooking Matters partners teach families how to make the most of the food budget so that families prepare affordable, nutritious meals. \n\n Cooking Matters uses collaborative model designed to enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of the cooking classes. Educational materials, training, evaluation, and national leadership are provided by Share Our Strength. Local partners, such as Cooperative Extension, deliver the program to meet the needs of their communities. Cooking Matters partners may already exist in your area \n\n Cooperative Extension agencies in many states across the nation have thriving partnerships with Cooking Matters. Likewise, Cooperative Extension is an excellent resource and is well positioned to help bridge the gap between home and school and increase the impact of nutrition education by providing the same messages to children at school as is given to the parents and adults. \n\n Cooperative Extension educators may be able to come directly to classrooms and/or afterschool programs to provide nutrition lessons, food demonstrations, cooking opportunities, and tasting experiences. Cooperative Extension programs like SNAP-Education, Expanded Food Nutrition Education, and 4-H use research-based curricula for different age groups and grade levels. The lessons are interactive, connected to many of the common core and state standards, and fun!

An introduction to \r\nbarcoded information, plot and plant identity systems we employ, \r\nconsiderations and the overall infrastructure will be presented. \r\n September 7, 2017. 2PM Eastern Time, 1PM Central, 12PM Mountain, 11AM Pacific Time \r\n\tPart 2: Collecting Data in the Field with Barcode-Based Digital Data Collection for Vegetable Breeding Programs \r\n Part will focus on field based aspects from transplant to field, \r\nmaterials and supplies required, and strategies to collect \r\nobservations in the field, including photography. \r\n September 28, 2017. 2PM Eastern Time, 1PM Central, 12PM Mountain, 11AM Pacific Time \r\n\tPart 3: Harvest Data and Final Analysis with Barcode-Based Digital Data Collection for Vegetable Breeding Programs \r\n Part will focus on harvest based component of the system with an \r\nemphasis on the connected instrumentation for dimensions, weights, \r\nphotographs and quality instruments and how data is compiled for final \r\nanalysis. At the conclusion, participants will be able to evaluate \r\nwhether they will choose to invest in this technology and will have \r\nexamples of how to get started in assembling their own data collection \r\npipeline. \r\n About the Presenter \r\n Michael Mazourek is the Calvin Knoyes Keeney associate professor in \r\nPlant Breeding and Genetics at Cornell University. His breeding program \r\nfocuses on the improvement of vegetable crops for organic production \r\nsystems and accompanying genomic analyses to identify genes under \r\nselection and develop tools to facilitate vegetable breeding progress. \r\nMichael teaches Plant Genetics and conducts on-farm and participatory \r\nplant breeding workshops including ones as part of NOVIC, the Northern \r\nOrganic Vegetable Improvement Collaborative. He has released several \r\ncultivars including the Habanada pepper, Martini cucumber, Trifecta \r\nmelon and an array of butternut squash. His program includes several \r\nvegetables, but has focus on pest and disease resistance in addition \r\nto flavor and convenience traits that promote the consumption of \r\nnaturally nutritious foods. \r\n Funding for this webinar series is being provided by USDA NIFA AFRI project entitled Genomic and Phenomic Tools to Support Vegetable Cultivar Development: Winter Squash as an Initial Target \r\n \n\n\n\n \n Tags \n \n seed production data collection organic production plant breeding genomics barcodes \n \n \n \n\n \n Sep \n 08 \n \n\n\n\n Facebook Live: Savings Challenge Check In \n\n 11:00 am EDT \n\n Dr. Barbara O\'Neill will check in with participants of the 30 Days Savings Challenge to see how their progress is going during the first week of the challenge.

Agricultural Safety and Health) \n\n Recognizing the importance of agricultural rescue training and the lack of such training for county and state emergency responders, members of the Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) Agricultural Safety and Health team developed the PAgricultural Rescue Training program to provide necessary training to emergency service workers so that they can respond effectively to agricultural emergencies. \n\n Website Link \n\n Click here to be directed to the PAgricultural Rescue Training website. \n\n Target Audience \n\n The training is designed for local emergency service workers, including fire, rescue, emergency medical services (EMS), county animal response team (CART), and police. \n\n Learning Objectives and Goals \n\n The PAgricultural Rescue Training program at Penn State is concerned with developing and delivering training that will: \n\n \n help emergency personnel become aware of the many hazards that could happen while managing an agricultural emergency. \n\t help emergency personnel understand the importance of preplanning for various farm emergencies in their communities. \n\t help fire, EMS, and CART units specialize in various aspects of agricultural rescue\xe2\x80\x94such as incidents involving machinery, chemicals, animals, or confined spaces\xe2\x80\x94and become technically competent in at least one of these areas. \n\t encourage fire, EMS, and CART units to work together to develop effective agricultural rescue strategies that will result in higher quality prehospital patient care and animal response. \n\t teach emergency responders to be proficient within their area of expertise (fire, rescue, EMS, CART) while managing farm emergencies. \n Learning Activities \n\n \n\n (Source: Pennsylvania State University. Agricultural Safety and Health) \n\n PAgricultural Rescue is divided into module units. Depending on the units, sessions are taught in one or two days of classroom instruction. Many of the training opportunities involve classroom instruction and hands-on experiential learning. The following modules are available: \n\n \n \n Agricultural Emergencies Awareness provides an overview of agricultural emergencies. \n\t \n Emergency Rescue in an Agricultural Environment trains responders about the uniqueness of farm rescues and provides instruction in the application of learned techniques in nonfarm emergencies. \n\t anaging Farm Chemical Emergencies trains responders to evaluate and respond to emergencies involving agricultural chemicals. \n\t \n Farm Confined Space Emergencies Awareness trains responders to recognize and evaluate various farm confined space emergencies. Participants learn to apply OSHA Confined Space Standards to confined space situations and to respond effectively to this type of emergency. \n\t \n Large Animal Rescue Training trains CART members and emergency responders to better manage emergencies involving large (farm) animals. \n\t \n Introduction to Grain Elevator and Feed Mill Fires teaches emergency responders about the importance of preplanning for fires and emergencies involving grain elevators and feed mills. \n\t \n Animals in Barn Fires provides participants with an understanding of farm animal behavior and how animals may react in fire situation. \n Evaluation \n\n Participants are required to complete pretest and posttest for each module and to perform certain hands-on activities (many of these activities, depending on subject area, are team based). Each participant completes class evaluation at the end of the training event.\xc2\xa0 \n\n \n\t \xc2\xa0 \n\n\t Use the following format to cite this article: \n\n\t PAgricultural rescue training.

It was designed\xc2\xa0both\xc2\xa0for youth living on family farms and for 14- and 15-year-olds who want to be certified under the provisions of the Agricultural Hazardous Occupations Order (AgHOs) \xc2\xa0to perform certain work activities on farm operation. AgHOs is set of federal safety and health standards that classify certain tasks as hazardous for youth under the age of 16. By participating in Gearing Up for Safety, youth are able to meet the AgHOs training requirements for operating tractor of more than 20 horsepower, connecting and disconnecting implements, and operating certain farm machines. \n\n Gearing Up for Safety is intended for national use through the Cooperative Extension Service and agricultural education programs, both of which are specifically identified by AgHOs as authorized to conduct AgHOs certification training. \n\n Curriculum \n\n The Gearing Up for Safety program includes Program Leaders\xe2\x80\x99s Guide (CD-ROM)\xc2\xa0that provides instructors with tools for organizing and conducting an agricultural safety training program that meets the requirements of AgHOs and addresses the most frequent causes of injuries and fatalities to youth in agriculture. The program also includes student CD-ROM consisting of 11 units that allows students to execute certain aspects of the training independently. The curriculum is also supported by an extensive website. (Click\xc2\xa0 here \xc2\xa0to be directed to the Gearing Up for Safety website.) \n\n The Program Leader\'s Guide includes the following components: \n\n \n Suggested teaching aids \n\t Core competencies that each student should master \n\t Graphics for presenting key points \n\t Lesson outlines with supplemental background information \n\t Activity worksheets \n\t Review test questions \n\t PowerPoint presentations \n\t Examples of farm injuries for classroom discussion \n\t Evaluation tools\n\t\t \n These evaluation tools\xc2\xa0assess students\' knowledge of material, ability to perform preoperational safety inspections, and ability to safely maneuver\xc2\xa0a tractor through standardized obstacle course. \n\t\t \n \n Program materials are available online and for purchase as CD-ROMs: \n\n \n Online curriculum:\xc2\xa0 http://www.ydae.purdue.edu/tractor/default.htm (Click on the Resource link and then the Curriculum link) \n\t Program Leader\xe2\x80\x99s Guide on CD-ROM:\xc2\xa0 http://www.finneyco.com/safetycd_leaders_guide.htm \n \n\t Student CD-ROM:\xc2\xa0 http://www.finneyco.com/safetycd.htm \n \n \xc2\xa0 \n\n Reviewed and Summarized by: \n\n Linda M.

The project was funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture. This program is now managed solely by Penn State. \n\n The NSTMOP was originally developed and designed for 14- and 15-year-olds seeking employment in production agriculture. The U.S. Department of Labor\xe2\x80\x99s Hazardous Occupations Order in Agriculture (AgHOs) regulation prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from operating farm tractors and attached powered equipment unless the youths have successfully completed an approved safe tractor and machinery operation training program. For more information about these regulations, click HERE to visit the website of the U.S. Department of Labor. \n\n Curriculum \n\n The NSTMOP consists of 24 hours of intensive instruction, divided into six modules, that includes task sheets and skills and safe-driving instruction. The task sheets serve as the basis of the program. The curriculum can be obtained through the following two avenues: \n\n \n Click HERE to order bound copy of the student manual through Finney Company Inc. \n\t Click HERE to be directed to\xc2\xa0the article ""NSTMOP: Student Information,"" which contains links to the different instruction modules in the Modules and Task Sheets section. \n The student manual includes the following elements: \n\n \n An introduction to the NSTMOP \n\t program outline for the six modules \n\t driving test layout and evaluation form \n\t list of core competencies that each student should master \n\t Instructional task sheets \n Evaluation \n\n Students must score minimum of 70% on the written knowledge test and must successfully pass the skills and driving tests administered by the instructor.\xc2\xa0 \n\n Students \n\n Instructors use NSTMOP task sheets for the 24 hours of intensive classroom instruction. After students complete the classroom training and pass the 50-question knowledge test with minimum score of 70%, they are permitted to take the skills and driving tests. After successfully completing both the classroom and driving components, students receive formal certificate that allows them to work for hire in agriculture as 14- and 15-year-olds.\xc2\xa0Click HERE for more information about the NSTMOP and what is expected of students to complete the program and earn formal certificate. \n\n Instructors \n\n NSTMOP is administered nationally through the Cooperative Extension Service and agricultural education programs.

Effective action by individuals at the scene of an accident can raise the likelihood of positive outcome for an injured victim. \n\n Click here to be directed to the Farm Family Emergency Response Program site. \n\n Program Details \n\n Target Audience \n\n The program is designed for individuals who work in production agriculture or live on farms or ranches or in rural areas. This training is especially important for farm and ranch managers and employees, spouses and family members living on farms or ranches, 4-H members, and FFA groups. \n\n Learning Objectives and Goals \n\n The Farm Family Emergency Response Program was designed to achieve the following objectives: \n\n \n To teach individuals how to keep themselves physically and emotionally safe during\xc2\xa0agricultural emergencies or rescues \n\t To teach individuals the types of actions\xc2\xa0that will have positive impact on the well-being of accident\xc2\xa0victims \n\t To teach people how to summon additional help and engage those individuals in the rescue response \n\t To reinforce the importance of first aid and CPR training\xc2\xa0for individuals involved in production agriculture \n Instructors \n\n Instructors for this program typically include Cooperative Extension educators, hospital personnel, agricultural education teachers, and emergency services instructors. The instructor materials include 20-minute tutorial explaining how to present the program, sample presentation demonstration, reproducible class materials, instructional materials, and module narratives. \n\n Learning Activities \n\n The Farm Family Emergency Response Program is divided into 12 modules that cover topics related to the primary causes of agricultural injury and death. Click here to view the topics of the 12 modules. Each module includes period for the discussion of prevention strategies. Participants are encouraged to implement safety strategies and recommendations on their farms and ranches.\xc2\xa0 \n\n Evaluation \n\n The instructor should measure the effectiveness of the class by having participants complete the pretest and posttest located in the instructor\xe2\x80\x99s manual. Participants complete registration cards that can be used for follow-up to determine whether participants made changes on their farms or ranches because of the program. \n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n Reviewed and Summarized by: \n\n \n Linda M.

The Economics of Agricultural Injury Prevention\xc2\xa0 (EOP)\xc2\xa0Program \xc2\xa0at the University of Kentucky provides resource material for teachers to educate their students about the high cost of injuries and the cost-effectiveness of injury prevention. The curriculum was designed for integration with core content in such subjects as economics, agricultural economics, and social studies, and it can be linked to required core content in multiple subject areas. \n\n Through the EOP Program, students participate in simulations, explore cost tools, watch documentaries and podcasts, and conduct web-based research assignments (called WebQuests). These activities provide students opportunities to enhance their critical thinking and decision making and to demonstrate their knowledge. \n\n If you are teacher or an administrator interested in learning more about this program, click here to be directed to the EOP homepage, and then click ""Teachers &amp; Admin"" in the column on left side of the page. The teachers and administrators section of the site includes information about the program\'s core content compliances, skills, story simulations, cost tools, digital documentaries, agricultural safety podcasts, and WebQuests. \n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n Reviewed and Summarized by: \n\n \n Linda M.

Hands-on tractor operation training is valuable because many new owners, operators, and workers are entering occupations such as production agriculture, agricultural services, forestry, landscaping, and golf-course maintenance that rely on agricultural tractors to complete tasks. \n\n Fewer people grow up learning how to operate tractors and equipment, so the manual is useful for training individuals with varying levels of tractor-driving experience and ability. In addition to training people involved in production agriculture, the manual can also be used to train volunteers \xc2\xa0who mow such places as school yards or churchyards, cemeteries, athletic fields, community parks, and the grounds at civic organizations such as the Lions Club \n\n The manual is comprehensive\xc2\xa0guide that provides information about the following topics: \n\n \n Choosing instructors, tractors, equipment, and driving courses \n\t Driving and operating tractors and equipment safely \n\t Conducting training workshops \n The manual also includes performance evaluation forms. \n\n To access the manual, click here to visit the website \n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n Reviewed and Summarized by: \n\n \n Glen Blahey, Canadian Agricultural Safety Association -GBlahey@casa-acsa.ca \n\n\t \n Linda M.

Until now, the agency has allowed only public entities with special FAA permits, called Certificates of Authorization (COAs) to fly unmanned aircraft, mostly for research purposes. \n\n On December 30, FAA picked six test sites from among 25 competing proposals to develop information that will help the agency develop the regulatory and legal frameworks that will enable unmanned civilian aircraft to share the skies with conventional aircraft. \n\n Among the chosen sites: the University of Alaska Virginia Tech and Texas &amp; Corpus Christ i. However, complex multi-institution partnerships in all six of the selected proposals should boost the number of land-grant universities directly involved in the program. \n\n Aiming to minimize risks to privacy and security and maximize public safety, the test sites will develop data on vehicle airworthiness, reliability of ground-to-air communication links, crash-avoidance, and training for pilots, flight crews, mechanics, and others. \n\n The promise of civilian unmanned aircraft \n\tEquipped with geospatial guidance systems and outfitted with remote-sensing equipment, unmanned aircraft can conduct research and safely perform jobs in areas/situations too dangerous, polluted, or impenetrable for on-ground operations. \n\n They can travel safely over or through mountains and swamps, through raging storms, and into radiation-polluted environments to collect essential data. They can effectively, rapidly, and inexpensively perform jobs that people find tedious and time-consuming, such as counting trees in large commercial nursery operations or checking the integrity of fences and pipelines. \n\n Compared with UAVs used in military operations, most civilian UAVs are smaller, lighter, and far less expensive. \n\n Their current and potential applications include firefighting, improved weather forecasting, non-invasive wildlife monitoring, infrastructure inspection, detecting patterns of coastal erosion, monitoring extreme weather events such as hurricanes and tornadoes, search-and-rescue operations, disaster response, newsgathering, collecting soil and water samples, and monitoring the health of forests, crops, and waterbodies. \n\n Unmanned aircraft are already used for border patrol and some law enforcement operations Though controversial, law enforcement use of drones for public safety emergencies, surveillance, and crowd control is expected to grow. \n\n What\xe2\x80\x99s in name? \n\tThe FAA defines an unmanned aircraft as \xe2\x80\x9cthe flying portion of the system, flown by pilot via ground control system, or autonomously through use of an on-board computer, communication links and any additional equipment that is necessary for the UA to operate safely.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n In various communities over the years, unmanned aircraft have gone by lot of different names: remotely piloted aircraft (RPV), remotely operated aircraft (ROA) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and the inelegant but most common name, drone. \n\n But preparing to integrate thousands of unmanned vehicles into the NAS, the main industry and government players have settled on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) term that includes not just the aircraft itself, but also its sophisticated navigation, communications, and data-collection systems. \n\n True UAS differ from remote-controlled hobby aircraft in that the UAS fly themselves, using onboard computers and pre-programmed routes. \n\n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n\n Marty Rogers directs the University of Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s Alaska Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integration, part of the university\xe2\x80\x99s Geophysical Institute and headquarters of the Pan-Pacific UAS Test Range Complex. \n\n The Alaska Center \xe2\x80\x9cis the largest and most comprehensive non-Department of Defense UAS research program in the nation,"" says Rogers, adding that the Center has conducted UAS research for 13 years, and currently manages fleet of more than 100 unmanned vehicles in eight different fixed- and rotary-wing configurations \n\n \xe2\x80\x9cOur project includes 13 test ranges and 58 partners: three state universities, UAS manufacturers, various small organizations, various state and local government agencies, international partners, and massive support network across the lower 48,\xe2\x80\x9d says Rogers. \n\n The data collected from all six test sites during the testing phase \xe2\x80\x9cwill be provided to the FAA as official data,\xe2\x80\x9d he adds. \xe2\x80\x9cIt formalizes and recognizes the industry as maturing technology and helps it move away from the \xe2\x80\x98cowboy mentality\xe2\x80\x99 of the past. \n\n \xe2\x80\x9cEvery emerging technology has its cowboys; without them we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here today. But inevitably the time comes when the cowboys are actually hurting what they once promoted.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n For his part, Rogers hopes the process of integrating civilian UAS technology into the NAS proceeds on schedule. He also says he\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconfident in the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to the safe integration of the technology and its benefits. Rogers also added \xe2\x80\x9cSafety is number one--no excuses, no alternatives--safety is the number one job, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the way it has to be. That is what is expected by the public, operators, users, clients, everyone--a safe system of integration.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n Big economic payoff \n\tNo monetary awards accompanied the The FAA test-site designations. So what\xe2\x80\x99s in it for the winners? \n\n Potentially enormous economic benefits. \n\n The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI), forecasts that between 2015 and 2025, civilian UAS will add $82.1 billion to the U.S. economy, along with 103,776 new, high-paying jobs that require technical degrees. \n\n The lion\xe2\x80\x99s share--$75.6 billion--will benefit the nation\xe2\x80\x99s agricultural sector; $3.2 will support public safety, and the rest will be scattered in other industries. \n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThe test-site areas will likely become business incubators, as manufacturers and others flock to them for access to the testing ranges,\xe2\x80\x9d says Rogers. As for local universities and community colleges research dollars and money will flow to them to expand or create new academic programs and train the new generation of engineers, pilots, software developers, and even journalists prepared to enter the lucrative UAS workforce \n\n The Cooperative Extension connection \n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to find land-grant university that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have faculty researchers and Extension staff involved (or eager for the chance to get involved) with UAS. \n\n Stephen Brown, an agriculture and natural resources agent for the Mat-Su and Copper River Districts of Alaska, came to the job with experience in precision agriculture and PhD focused on geospatial technologies. \n\n He was part of team that helped recover debris scattered across north-central and eastern Texas after the loss of Space Shuttle Columbia in 2003. \n\n mountaineer, marathoner, and Iditarod musher, Brown owns four snowmobiles, each outfitted with different tools and equipment. He chuckles, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re probably the only Extension service in the nation that reimburses for snowmobile mileage.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n \xe2\x80\x9cUAVs would really improve the efficiency of the Extension system here,\xe2\x80\x9d Brown says. \xe2\x80\x9cI cover huge and variable area the size of Georgia. I\xe2\x80\x99d love to be able to dispatch drone to farm 100 miles from here to take and maybe even analyze soil sample. Right now, it can take me three or four hours one way overland to fetch single sample.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n Brown adds, \xe2\x80\x9cSome of our farmers don\xe2\x80\x99t even know how much cropland they farm; it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to make an accurate fertilizer recommendation using estimates that can be way off. UAV could easily and accurately measure field.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n Brown envisions the day when small, energy-efficient, unmanned ground and aerial vehicles would combine to measure an area, test the soil, spread the right amount of fertilizer only where needed, plant seeds, monitor crop health, measure soil moisture and irrigate, and monitor for disease, insect pests, and weeds, dispensing pesticides only when and where needed. Indeed, that day that has already arrived for some farmers \n\n Since 2008, an interdisciplinary group of Extension collaborators from four land-grants--the Universities of Oregon, Florida, and Arkansas, and Virginia Tech--has expanded their research in ground-based precision agriculture to aerial operations. \n\n The group includes specialists with expertise in horticulture, plant physiology, forestry, and biological/agricultural engineering, as well as several cooperating commercial nurseries. They\xe2\x80\x99ve applied their research to citrus crops in Florida, ornamental nursery crops in Arkansas and Virginia, and Christmas-tree production in Oregon. \n\n The first task they tackled: managing inventory \xe2\x80\x9cWe were all trying to answer the same question,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jim Robbins, Extension commercial ornamental horticulture specialist at the University of Arkansas. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do we automate the process of counting plants in open-field situations?\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n \xe2\x80\x9cFor large operations, this requires humans to walk miles and miles, row after row, counting individual plants,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jim Owen, extension horticulture specialist at Virginia Tech\xe2\x80\x99s Hampton Roads Agricultural Research and Extension Center \xe2\x80\x9cOther kinds of operations might be dealing with very rough terrain.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWe were fortunate to collaborate with three engineers,\xe2\x80\x9d says Robbins. The engineers designed and built what they call an Autonomous Platform for Precision Agriculture (APPA) from off-the-shelf materials. The APPA combines low cost, vertical takeoff and landing, ability to hover, in-air stability, and ease of operator training. \n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWe\'ve found that with aerial photography, we can look at large acreage in minutes and monitor inventory with close to 100 percent accuracy,\xe2\x80\x9d says Owen. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is quite task, since single nursery can contain hundreds of taxa (different classes of trees and shrubs).\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n Members of the group have already moved on to using the APPA to monitor disease in citrus groves, estimate crop yields, and monitor nutrient and water stress. \n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re very excited about the future of aerial operations,\xe2\x80\x9d says Owen.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cBut many questions remain when we ask what happens to the data as we go up in the air.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n Learn more Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) \xc2\xa0 Comprehensive information about the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s plans to integrate UAS into the national airpspace.

The SAY Curriculum Alignment Submission Tool (CAST)\xc2\xa0is an online instrument that participants use to submit an agricultural safety and health Formal Curriculum or Other Supporting Resource to SAY for possible inclusion in the national clearinghouse.\xc2\xa0 Note:\xc2\xa0Explanations of the terms\xc2\xa0 Formal Curriculum \xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0 Other Supporting Resource \xc2\xa0are included in the \xe2\x80\x9cProviding Submitter and Submission Information\xe2\x80\x9d section below.\xc2\xa0For convenience, these official terms\xc2\xa0are replaced by the term\xc2\xa0 curriculum/other resource \xc2\xa0in most places in CAST and in these directions. \n\n Materials submitted should align in some part with the Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources (AFNR) Career Cluster Content Standards promoted by the National Council for Agricultural Education and the National FFA Foundation. currently existing curriculum/other resource may not align\xc2\xa0 closely\xc2\xa0 to these standards because the standards are relatively new to the agricultural safety and health community. However, even curriculum/other resource with low level of alignment can be valuable educational resource for the SAY National Clearinghouse.\xc2\xa0Those not familiar with the AFNR Career Cluster Content Standards are strongly advised to study them thoroughly before submitting curriculum/other resource. If your curriculum/other resource aligns with AFNR Career Cluster Content Standard(s), it will be added to the SAY National Clearinghouse and assigned high, medium, or low alignment. The alignment is based on the information that you provide in your submission so please be clear and concise. The following definitions outline the three alignment categories: \n\n High Alignment \xe2\x80\x94The curriculum/other resource aligns very well with this component of the Performance Indicator. \n\n Medium Alignment \xe2\x80\x94The curriculum/other resource has moderate degree of alignment with this component of the\xc2\xa0Performance Indicator. \n\n Low Alignment \xe2\x80\x94The curriculum/other resource does not align well with this component of the\xc2\xa0Performance Indicator, but enough common language is involved to conclude that some alignment exists. \n\n Before you begin the submission process, click HERE to open the latest version of the safety related AFNR Career Cluster Content Standards, Performance Indicators and Measurements. Print copy so you can refer to it when completing your submission. This document will help you compare the objectives, goals or outcomes of your curriculum/other resource with those of AFNR. You will notice three shades of green (or gray). The darker shade is the Common Career Technical Core Standards. These are the broadest level of standards, and ultimately what your curriculum/other resource will align to. You will notice that these are very broad statements so more specific statements are listed below these. The middle shade is the \xe2\x80\x98Indicators\xe2\x80\x99. When you actually submit your information in the submission template, you will be submitting under the appropriate Indicators. Because these too are very broad, you will notice various statements below each indicator. These are the lightest shade. These measurements are examples of standards under the specific indicators. To us, it makes sense to compare your curriculum/other resource objectives and activities with these statements, because they are more specific. \n\n As you compare your objectives and activities with the AFNR measurements, we suggest making note of the lesson/page number(s)/activity that relate to the AFNR measurement. You may find that there are multiple activities that together will meet some measurements. For example, participants may need to complete group or skills activity and/or correctly answer evaluation questions. You will be asked to enter this information on the CAST. \n\n Once you feel that your program\'s objectives come close to these examples, you are ready to start filling in the submission template (CAST). After printing these directions,\xc2\xa0 click HERE to access CAST to submit your curriculum/other resource. \n\n Providing Submitter and Submission Information \n\n In the first part of CAST, you will provide information about the submitting organization and the materials to be submitted. The explanations that follow will help you complete this task. \n\n Name of Submitter: \xc2\xa0Name of the person submitting the curriculum/other resource. This person should be an author or someone working with the author(s). \n\n Name of Organization: \xc2\xa0Name of the organization that created and/or published the curriculum/other resource. \n\n Email Address: \xc2\xa0Email address of the person making the submission. \n\n Phone: \xc2\xa0Phone number for the person making the submission. \n\n Title of Educational Resource: \xc2\xa0Name of the curriculum/other resource being submitted. \n\n Type of Submission: \xc2\xa0Choose\xc2\xa0 Formal Curriculum \xc2\xa0or\xc2\xa0 Other Supporting Resource \xc2\xa0by clicking the appropriate button. Choose only one option. The term\xc2\xa0 Formal Curriculum \xc2\xa0refers to material that: 1) has learning goals or objectives that are clearly stated; 2) includes subject matter content supportive of the learning goals or objectives; and 3) has an evaluation component (for example, some type of student assessment, such as quiz). The term\xc2\xa0 Other Supporting Resource \xc2\xa0refers to more individualized, originally authored resources, such as technical fact sheet series, video clips, PowerPoint presentations, or other materials that lack one or more of the three elements of Formal Curriculum. Both types of materials may be supportive of AFNR Career Cluster Content Standards and can be valuable educational materials for youth agricultural safety and health. \n\n Date Published/Latest Revision:\xc2\xa0 Materials should have been authored or revised within the past 10 years. \n\n Check the format of the curriculum/other resource you are submitting: \xc2\xa0Choose the best description of the format of the curriculum/other resource. If the curriculum/other resource\xc2\xa0is available only in hard-copy form, choose\xc2\xa0 hard copy If an electronic version is available, choose\xc2\xa0 online/electronic If the curriculum/other resource\xc2\xa0 is\xc2\xa0 available electronically, provide link in the Describe how others can access this curriculum/other resource \xc2\xa0item in this part of the submission tool (described below). If the curriculum/other resource\xc2\xa0is available in hard-copy form only, mail copy to Davis Hill, 204B Agricultural Engineering Building, University Park, PA 16802. \n\n Describe in sentence or two the curriculum/other resource being submitted: \xc2\xa0Provide couple of sentences that describe the curriculum/other resource. Include information such as training type (for example, online training, in-person training, field day, and so on); intended length of the program; and unique aspects of the curriculum/other resource. \n\n Check the age group(s) of the target audience: \xc2\xa0Choose all age groups that apply for the target audience of the curriculum/other resource. \n\n List the learning goals, objectives, or outcomes of the curriculum/other resource: \xc2\xa0Provide the learning goals/objectives/expected outcomes for the curriculum/other resource. \n\n Describe the testing/evaluation component(s) of the curriculum/other resource: \xc2\xa0Provide brief description of the testing/evaluation component of the curriculum/other resource. If there is no testing or evaluation component because the material is an Other Supporting Resource submission, type \xe2\x80\x9cNot Applicable.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n Describe how others can access the curriculum/other resource: \xc2\xa0Provide brief explanation of how people can access the curriculum/other resource. For example, state that the curriculum/other resource is available online through university, and provide the applicable website. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \n\n After you have entered the required information about the submitter and the submission, click the\xc2\xa0forward arrow\xc2\xa0to continue to the part of CAST in which you will provide information about how your materials align with the AFNR Common Career Technical Core Standards.\xc2\xa0 CAUTION: Use\xc2\xa0 only\xc2\xa0 the forward and back arrows at the bottom right of the screen to navigate within CAST (Figure 1).\xc2\xa0 Do not use the browser arrows \xc2\xa0(if you do so, your information may be lost). \n\n \n\n Fig. 1. Forward and back arrows on the CAST screen. \n\n Completing the Self-Assessment of Alignment to AFNR Standards \n\n The Curriculum Alignment Committee and SAY team members have identified the AFNR Career Cluster Content Standards that include agricultural safety and health Indicators and Measurements. For each relevant standard, CAST presents block of questions you will use to supply information about the alignment of your materials to the standard. The block of questions is the same for each standard. The steps that follow provide information for completing the self-assessment of alignment to the standards. \n\n \n The first question asks whether your curriculum/other resource aligns with specific Common Career Technical Core Standard. (Figure 2). Answer by choosing\xc2\xa0 Yes\xc2\xa0 or\xc2\xa0 No If you answer \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0the next question in the block for the specified\xc2\xa0Common Career Technical Core Standard displays.\xc2\xa0If you answer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0the first question for the next \xc2\xa0Common Career Technical Core Standard displays. \n \xc2\xa0 \n\n \n\n Fig. 2. Example of the first question in each block. \n\n \n After indicating that your curriculum/other resource aligns to the specified\xc2\xa0Common Career Technical Core Standard, identify the particular\xc2\xa0Performance Indicator(s) with which your curriculum/other resource aligns. Each Performance Indicator for the specified Common Career Technical Core Standard is listed with corresponding check box (Figure 3). Your curriculum/other resource might align with multiple Performance Indicators, so choose\xc2\xa0 all\xc2\xa0 that apply.\xc2\xa0 \n \n\n Fig. 3. Example of Indicators. \n\n For each indicator that you check, you will need to indicate where the subject matter is located in your curriculum/resource that aligns with the indicator. Type this information in the text box below each of the indicator(s) and note that the size of the text box can be increased by clicking on the corner and expanding the box.\xc2\xa0 We suggest referring to the sample measurements in the downloaded document to help decide which specific indicator to list your material. It would be most helpful to us if you listed the sample measurement number with your submission. For example, in Figure 4, we have listed Lesson 7, pgs. 47-50 under CS.03.02 to say that the curriculum being submitted relates somewhat to measurements under this indicator and this can be found in Lesson (on pages 47-50) of the submitted curriculum. That would make it easy for us to find and confirm. \n\n \n\n Figure 4. Stating location indicator is addressed in your curriculum/resource. \n\n Thank you for submitting your curriculum/other resource for possible inclusion in the SAY National Clearinghouse. If you have questions about the curriculum/other resource submission process, contact Dave Hill at deh27@psu.edu or (814) 865-2808. \n\n Summarized by: \n\n Linda M.

An SAE provides student with an experiential learning opportunity and is based on one or more of the following categories: entrepreneurship, placement, research and experimentation, or exploration. \n\n Importance of an Injury Risk Assessment Protocol for SAEs \n\n The SAE is broadly defined experience for students and can include but is not limited to working in job or an internship on farm or ranch, owning and operating an agricultural business, planning and conducting scientific experiment, or exploring agricultural career opportunities. The\xc2\xa0Injury Risk Assessment\xc2\xa0for SAEs protocol\xc2\xa0is resource for evaluating\xc2\xa0work sites to assess risks\xc2\xa0for individuals involved\xc2\xa0with\xc2\xa0production-based SAEs\xc2\xa0on\xc2\xa0those work sites. Production-based SAE safety evaluations and risk assessments must be integral parts of agricultural educators\xe2\x80\x99 visits\xc2\xa0to production-based SAE sites. Click\xc2\xa0 here \xc2\xa0to learn more about the importance of safety in production-based SAEs. \n\n Components of the Injury Risk Assessment for SAEs Protocol \n\n The Injury Risk Assessment for SAEs protocol includes the following components:\xc2\xa0 \n\n SAE Safety Daily Lesson Plan \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 The daily lesson plan provides agricultural educators with complete 30-minute lesson that includes an\xc2\xa0 SAE Safety slide presentation \n\n SAE Code of Practice for Safety Risk Assessment \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 Educators, employers, and/or parents can have students review and sign this agreement form to state that they will represent their school and FFA Chapter\xc2\xa0positively\xc2\xa0with regard to promoting and strengthening student safety while completing an SAE. The Code of Practice should be completed at the beginning of student\xe2\x80\x99s SAE or the beginning of each school year or as an assignment related to unit of instruction in an SAE. \n\n Student Self-Assessment of SAE \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 Students complete this self-evaluation to assess an SAE in relation to supervision, working conditions, and emergencies. The self-assessment should be completed by students as an assignment\xc2\xa0within the first two weeks of an SAE. An administrator of the SAE should file the completed form for future reference. \n\n Teacher/Parent/Employer Safety Assessment of Student\xe2\x80\x99s SAE \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 This easy-to-use assessment form was developed specifically for teacher, parent, or an employer to conduct safety assessment of student\xe2\x80\x99s SAE, based on the job, working conditions, and injury preparedness. Ideally, this form should be completed after the student completes the SAE Code of Practice and Student Self-Assessment documents and after or in conjunction with scheduled SAE visit.\xc2\xa0Again, an administrator of the SAE should file\xc2\xa0the completed form for future reference. \n\n Return to the Safety in Agriculture for Youth (SAY) page. \n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n Reviewed and Summarized by: \n\n Linda M.

Their purpose was to initiate constructive dialogue about ideas, resources, gaps, and best practices for safely involving youth on the farm or ranch, regardless of whether the youth are working for family operations or for general hire. \n\n The symposium was held October 27\xe2\x80\x9328, 2014, in Louisville, Kentucky.\xc2\xa0 For PDF of the symposium program, please click here \n\n This article identifies the keynote speakers and provides links to video clips from each of the four plenary sessions. \n\n Plenary One: Current Regulations\xe2\x80\x94the Good, the Bad, and the Opportunities \n\n Brad Rein National Institute of Food and Agriculture, USDA \n\n \n Video of Plenary Speaker1: Brad Rein, National Youth Farm and Ranch Youth Safety Symposium \n \n\n\n Karen Garnett U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division \n\n \n Video of Plenary Speaker 2: Karen Garnett, National Youth Farm and Ranch Youth Safety Symposium \n \n\n\n Shari Burgus Farm Safety for Just Kids \n\n *Marilyn Adams Farm Safety for Just Kids \n\n \n Video of Plenary Speaker 3: Shari Burgus, National Youth Farm and Ranch Youth Safety Symposium \n \n\n\n Barbara Lee National Children\xe2\x80\x99s Center for Rural and Agricultural Health and Safety \n\n \n Video of Plenary Speaker 4: Barbara Lee, National Youth Farm and Ranch Youth Safety Symposium \n \n\n\n Dawn Castillo National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health \n\n \n Video of Plenary Speaker 5: Dawn Castillo, National Youth Farm and Ranch Youth Safety Symposium \n \n\n\n Aida Balsano National Institute of Food and Agriculture, USDA \n\n \n Video of Plenary Speaker 6: Dr. Aida Balsano, National Youth Farm and Ranch Youth Safety Symposium \n \n\n\n Plenary Two: Youth for Hire\xe2\x80\x94Employment Options in Agriculture \n\n Karen Garnett U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division \n\n \n Video of Plenary Speaker1: Karen M.

Implicit bias is defined as unconscious beliefs and stereotypes (Banks, Eberhardt &amp; Ross, 2006). There is evidence that disproportionality in disciplinary practices is impacted by teachers\xe2\x80\x99 responses to perceived behaviors that are based on racial stereotypes and implicit bias (McIntosh, et al., 2015).\xc2\xa0 Teachers who view African Americans as dangerous and difficult to control are more likely to use punitive disciplinary measures such as suspensions and expulsions (Monroe, 2005). \n \n Use the Pyramid Model \n \n This model provides early childhood personnel with the tools to promote and enhance social emotional development in young children. The Center on the Social Emotional Foundations for Early Learning (CSEFEL) defines social-emotional development as the ability of children age birth to five to identify, experience and respond appropriately to variety of emotions.\xc2\xa0 Early childhood professionals use the Pyramid Model to promote social-emotional competence by intentionally teaching skills for expressing emotions, making friends, developing relationships with adults and other children, in the context of the child\xe2\x80\x99s family and community (Center on the Social Emotional Foundations for Early Learning, 2008). \n To learn more about implicit bias and its impacts in your professional environment, join us for the MFLN Virtual Conference Sept. 26-29.\xc2\xa0 Rosemarie will have session on Sept. 29 at 11 a.m. EST entitled \xe2\x80\x9c Implicit Bias:\xc2\xa0 From Awareness to Positive Change .\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 To learn more about the full conference, click here \n\t \n\n\t\n \n\n \n\t\t \n\t\t Posted on September 5, 2017 August 29, 2017 Making Changes: An Invitation to Learn through Change \t \n\n\t\n\t \n\t\t By: Bari Sobelson and Hannah Hyde \n \n The field of dietetics is rapidly changing \xc2\xa0 \n New information is often emerging on how to best manage diet. Additionally, dietary trends are changing with lot of incorrect information circulating which can be difficult for our patients to navigate It is crucial that we stay current on all of the changes as it is our responsibility to help our patients translate science into action. \xc2\xa0 \n \n As dietitians, we work with patients and clients to change behaviors that are part of their daily lives and this is not always an easy task! Remember though, if the changes that our patients and clients were trying to make were easy they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be coming to us! While our jobs center on getting others to change their behaviors, some of us may struggle with change within our personal lives because of perceived lack of time for activities, such as self-reflection and care. \xc2\xa0We help others change but we acknowledge, recognize, and accept that change is hard for everyone. If this blog speaks to you from both professional and personal standpoint, then we have an opportunity for you that you won&#8217;t want to pass up!\xc2\xa0 \n If you are interested in learning how to navigate through change join us for our free four-day virtual conference to LEARN strategies for managing change GROW your understanding of your capacity for change and begin to THRIVE as you connect with colleagues facing similar challenges. \xc2\xa0To learn more information about this exciting opportunity, click here \xc2\xa0 \n \n This blog was written by Social Media Specialists Bari Sobelson of the MFLN Family Development Team and Hannah Hyde of the MFLN Military Caregiving Team \xc2\xa0Find out more about the Military Families Learning Network on our website Facebook and Twitter .\xc2\xa0 \n\t \n\n\t\n \n\n\t \n\t\t Posts navigation \n\t\t Page \n Page \n &hellip; \n Page 576 \n Next page \n\t \n\t\t \n\t \n\t\n \n\t Blog Posts by Category \t\t\t \n Network News \n Child Care \n Community Capacity Building \n Family Development \n Family Transitions \n Military Caregiving \n Network Literacy \n Nutrition and Wellness \n Personal Finance \n Uncategorized \n \n \n\t\t Archives \t\t Archives \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t Select Month \n\t\t\t\t September 2017 \n\t August 2017 \n\t July 2017 \n\t June 2017 \n\t May 2017 \n\t April 2017 \n\t March 2017 \n\t February 2017 \n\t January 2017 \n\t December 2016 \n\t November 2016 \n\t October 2016 \n\t September 2016 \n\t August 2016 \n\t July 2016 \n\t June 2016 \n\t May 2016 \n\t April 2016 \n\t March 2016 \n\t February 2016 \n\t January 2016 \n\t December 2015 \n\t November 2015 \n\t October 2015 \n\t September 2015 \n\t August 2015 \n\t July 2015 \n\t June 2015 \n\t May 2015 \n\t April 2015 \n\t March 2015 \n\t February 2015 \n\t January 2015 \n\t December 2014 \n\t November 2014 \n\t October 2014 \n\t September 2014 \n\t August 2014 \n\t July 2014 \n\t June 2014 \n\t May 2014 \n\t April 2014 \n\t March 2014 \n\t February 2014 \n\t January 2014 \n\t December 2013 \n\t November 2013 \n\t October 2013 \n\t September 2013 \n\t August 2013 \n\t July 2013 \n\t June 2013 \n\t May 2013 \n\t April 2013 \n\t March 2013 \n\t February 2013 \n\t January 2013 \n\t December 2012 \n\t November 2012 \n\t October 2012 \n\t September 2012 \n\t August 2012 \n\t July 2012 \n\t June 2012 \n\t May 2012 \n\t April 2012 \n\t March 2012 \n\t February 2012 \n\t January 2012 \n\t December 2011 \n\t November 2011 \n\t October 2011 \n\t September 2011 \n\t August 2011 \n\t July 2011 \n\n\t\t \n\t\t Connect and Learn \t\t\t \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n \n\t\t MFLN on Twitter \t\t\t Tweets about ""#mfln OR @milfamln"" \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \n\t\t Blog Posts by RSS \t\t\t \r\n Posts by RSS \r\n\r\n \r\n Comments by RSS \n\t\t Graphic Standards Guidelines \n MFLN Reports \n \n \n\n\n\t\t \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t This material is based upon work supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Office of Military Family Readiness Policy, U.S. Department of Defense under Award Number 2015-48770-24368 \n\t\t \t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \t\t\t Blog Dashboard \n\t\t \t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\n \n \n eXtension Members \n Privacy \n Contact Us \n Terms of Use \n \n \xc2\xa9 2017 eXtension.

Our focus connects largely to early intervention, family strengthening, family violence prevention and treatment and has targeted individuals in the mental health, family advocacy, and education fields. \n Early Intervention (EI) operates within the Family Development team of the Military Families Learning Network (MFLN). The overall purpose of EI is to enhance the capacity of professionals working with military families who have young children (birth to years old) with or who are at-risk for disabilities and developmental delays. \n We welcome you to explore and connect with us on this online community. \n Resources \n Blog Posts \n Webinars \n Virtual Conferences \n Books, Journal Articles and Websites \n Newsletters \n PR Material \n Podcasts \n\n\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t https://militaryfamilies.extension.org/podcast-player/17284/anchored-episode-8-four-legged-healers-exploring-animal-assisted-therapy.mp3 https://militaryfamilies.extension.org/podcast-player/16441/anchored-episode-7-the-forward-march-the-journey-from-military-to-civilian-life.mp3 https://militaryfamilies.extension.org/podcast-player/16627/anchored-episode-6-private-parts-exploring-intimacy-issues-with-couples.mp3 https://militaryfamilies.extension.org/podcast-player/16625/anchored-episode-5-the-war-within-impact-of-post-military-combat-ptsd-on-military-couples-and-families.mp3 https://militaryfamilies.extension.org/podcast-player/16623/anchored-episode-4-early-intervention-matters-a-parents-perspective.mp3 https://militaryfamilies.extension.org/podcast-player/16621/anchored-episode-3-baby-blues-clues-a-glimpse-at-postpartum-depression.mp3 https://militaryfamilies.extension.org/podcast-player/16618/anchored-episode-2-married-to-the-military.mp3 https://militaryfamilies.extension.org/podcast-player/16613/anchored-episode-1-we-are-family-family-dynamics-of-today.mp3 \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\t \n\t\t\n View all Podcasts and Earn CEUs \n Meet Our Teams \n Family Development \n Learn more about our Family Development team \n \n \n \n \n \n Kacy Mixon PhD, LMFT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Bari Sobelson MS, LMFT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Caitlyn Brown MS \n \n \n \n Early Intervention \n Learn more about our Early Intervention team \n \n \n \n \n \n Amy Santos PhD \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Michalaene Ostrosky PhD \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Robyn DiPietro-Wells \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Kimberly Hile \n \n \n \n Recent Facilitators \n Meet all our Facilitators and learn about their programming \n \n \n \n \n \n Catherine Mogil PsyD \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Melissa Merrick PhD \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Elizabeth Gershoff PhD \n \n \n \n \n\t \n \n\n\t\t \n\t \n \n \n\t Recent Posts Racial Disproportionality in Early Childhood Discipline Preventing Intimate Partner Violence Across the Lifespan: Technical Package from The CDC How Do You Manage Change?

Yet it is seldom addressed as topic in its own right. Deliberation is defined as the weighing of policy choices by the public. It involves critical thinking and open dialogue that creates sense of the public and the movement towards common ground. This article address the problems associated with deliberation: 1) hyperindividualism; 2) culture of limited public dialogue; and 3) the increased hegemony of science and technology. The National Issues Forum (NIF) methodology was employed as tool to overcome these problems of deliberation in rural Kentucky. naturalistic evaluation model was used to critique the application of NIF in rural settings.

In order to successfully integrate civil dialogue into the LGU work, an understanding of how the two fit together\xe2\x80\x94or are challenged to do so\xe2\x80\x94will help pave the way to successful university-community collaboration (see Wright, 2012). \n \n Understand the history of Extension as grassroots knowledge-sharing and relationship-building institution, particularly the role that group discussion and civil dialogue has played in its history (Shaffer, 2016). \n Recognize how dialogue can strengthen Extension work with communities (Hustedde, 1996) \n Articulate the value of civil dialogue to both the LGU as well as to communities \n Balance \xe2\x80\x9cdeliver science based knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d with community engagement to work alongside communities for solutions (Peters, 2014). \n Recognize community building as one of everyone in Extension\xe2\x80\x99s tasks. \n Address common misperceptions of Extension\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in civil dialogue such as Extension\xe2\x80\x99s mission and potential roles in conflict. \n Understand Extension\xe2\x80\x99s own unique challenges in reaching all audiences within given community. \n \n \n III. \xc2\xa0Background Analysis \n Before engaging the community in civil dialogue, good understanding of the situation is needed.\xc2\xa0 This foundation should identify major stakeholders/viewpoints, provide baseline data related to the scope of the issue, and articulate the issue clearly to those that might be interested in engaging in conversation. \n \n Understand and acknowledge how issues become controversial \n Identify key elements of the situation including why the issue is contentious, scale and trends locally, historical background, stakeholders, power-brokers, and assets/resources available. \n Know where to find and how to analyze relevant data \n Determine if dialogue project should be undertaken based on analysis \n Frame an issue in neutral, inclusive, non-threatening manner in order to promote productive, civil deliberative discussion. \n Quickly adapt the analysis and associated framing as new information is identified or as the situation changes. \n \n \n IV. \xc2\xa0Community Organizing \n Once determination is made to hold dialogue session, organizing the community to ensure diverse, broad-base of participants relative to the situation is essential to success. \n \n Understand the elements of creating safe space for dialogue relative to organization (geographic location, timing, selecting moderators and facilitators, etc.) \n Identify, recruit, and lead planning team that is representative of the voices within the issue and of the community itself and including those already active on the issue and also youth. Fully engage them in the planning process. \n Garner needed resources for successful dialogue. \n Understand the different approaches to engagement and dialogue and properly identify the best approach for the situation. \n Craft community invitations that clearly articulate the purpose and that reach all relevant stakeholder groups effectively, using multiple sources and mediums that are appropriate to the situation. Invite involvement rather than mandating participation. \n Identify and train volunteers for facilitating civil dialogue. \n Understand the various leadership roles that may be present in dialogue planning and implementation process (facilitator/coordinator/coach/teacher/co-creator/convener/trainer); determine the appropriate role for yourself in the situation, weighing both professional and personal aspects. \n \n \n V. \xc2\xa0Processes and Skills in Dialogue \n Effectively facilitating dialogue process involves watchful attention to how people are interacting together throughout the effort.\xc2\xa0 Attention to key areas are vital to success. \n \n Design process appropriate to the situation and available time. State as clearly as possible the approach, timeframe, and goals of the dialogue process. \n Manage the facilitator role appropriately (neutral, interjecting questions or comments appropriately). \n Foster safe and inviting environment for dialogue. \n Assist the group in developing shared vision. \n Support the group in setting norms or group agreements \n Maintain positive conversation flow, shepherding dialogue progression through appropriate questions, reflective silence, and natural dialogue among participants. \n Foster respectful, balanced, and authentic discussion among all dialogue participants. \n Understand the principles of group dynamics (group think, group polarization, influence, and power) and adapt processes as needed. \n Employ conflict resolution/management/mediation skills appropriately. \n Use summarization and synthesis methods to check group and individual understanding. \n Guide the group toward brainstorming solutions. \n Help the group consider tensions, trade-offs, and priorities among potential solutions. \n Employ variety of decision-making process as needed to fit the group and issue. \n Recognize when and how to transition the group from dialogue to action, if/when appropriate. \n Recognize and plan for on-going dialogue in the face of change. \n \n \n VI. \xc2\xa0Dialogue to Action \n In some instances, dialogue that results in common and shared understanding may be an end goal by itself.\xc2\xa0 However, often dialogue on challenging issues will lead toward collective community action to address or respond to an issue.\xc2\xa0 During this time, maintaining the open, connected, and exploratory atmosphere created during the dialogue phase is vital to community progress and trust-building. \n \n Guide the group through the process of identifying community assets that may support efforts moving forward. \n Help the group set and work toward reasonable goals. \n Guide groups in developing and implementing action plans. \n Encourage community members to embrace leadership opportunities to take action and support their work. \n Track, report, and celebrate progress. \n \n \n VII. \xc2\xa0Cultural Competencies \n Creating space for civil dialogue within our diverse and complex society requires acknowledgement and understanding of cultural differences as well as sensitivity for how to bring diverse individuals and groups together so that productive dialogue can occur. \n \n Understand foundational issues that are sometimes present in multi-cultural dialogue and the need to address these, either in planning or directly with participants. \xc2\xa0Examples of these foundational issues are: \xc2\xa0assimilation,\xc2\xa0bias,\xc2\xa0discrimination,\xc2\xa0equality,\xc2\xa0equity, implicit bias, institutional racism, integration, micro aggressions, oppression, power, social identity, social justice, and white privilege. \n Acknowledge history of and current state of oppression of various cultural and ethnic groups (racial trauma, violence, etc.) and how those differ from familiar dominant narratives. \n Demonstrate understanding of how to work with diverse audiences (relate to, understand, adapt programming, and promote partnering, etc.) \n Present information in non-judgmental way to help people grow and mature through dialogue process. \n Recognize elements of culture dynamics such as development, values, beliefs, etc. \n Identify myths, stereotypes, perceptions, and biases and work to effectively understand and overcome them. \n Facilitate meaningful discussions that differentiate between tolerance, acceptance, appreciation and celebration. \n Understand the needs of groups/voices that are marginalized and underrepresented (identifying, recruiting to the table, and creating safe/trusting space for participation). \n Identify common values or interests among groups. \n Understand and communicate multiple perspectives on challenging issues. \n Create process that is inclusive and values differences \n \n \n VIII. \xc2\xa0Other Kinds of Diversity \n \n Understand how to work with different personality types in group settings. \n Adapt processes to allow for participation of those with differing learning styles. \n Manage groups that may involve different skill levels in dialogue. \n Understand and adapt efforts to meet the needs of communities at risk. \n \n \n IX. \xc2\xa0 Emotional Intelligence and Management \n Topics and issues well suited to civil dialogue are often emotionally charged with strongly held views from multiple perspectives.\xc2\xa0 Facilitators must be able to manage emotional responses as well as coach participants in productive management of emotion. \n \n Demonstrate ability to regulate one\xe2\x80\x99s own emotion as well as assist others, especially in moments of high tension \n Recognize that feelings/emotions are an important way of knowing and experiencing the world alongside factually-based information and expert knowledge. \n Create processes that encourage and invite all emotions into the space as source of healing and transformation \n \n \n X. \xc2\xa0Facilitator Attitude and Disposition \n To facilitate civil dialogue, especially on race relations, one must have certain attitudes and dispositions in order to convene diverse people for civil dialogue. \n \n Approach facilitation with open-mindedness and humility that allows one to serve as neutral and objective facilitator of dialogue. \n Maintain respect for diverse individuals and positions by having patience for how dialogue participants might engage in civil dialogue while striving for credibility and trustworthiness in how issues are discussed. \n Demonstrate willingness and ability to listen to understand. \n Exercising care to ensure that one\xe2\x80\x99s own conversation promotes positive interactions such as avoiding trigger words or concepts that may hinder conversations. \n Have flexibility to modify processes and/or approach as necessary. Also recognize your own limits. Strive to create an environment in which individuals are comfortable and desire to understand one another and the issues discussed. \n Have self-awareness about one\xe2\x80\x99s own culture, values, and biases and how they influence facilitation. \n Maintain willingness to see the community as having valid knowledge and/or more knowledge than expertise from the university. \n Be aware of one\xe2\x80\x99s own triggers while facilitating and have outlets for debriefing and decompressing around the challenging issues that arise in civil dialogue work across differences. \n \n _____________________________ \n References: \n \n Hustedde, R.

Yet it is seldom addressed as topic in its own right. Deliberation is defined as the weighing of policy choices by the public. It involves critical thinking and open dialogue that creates sense of the public and the movement towards common ground. This article address the problems associated with deliberation: 1) hyperindividualism; 2) culture of limited public dialogue; and 3) the increased hegemony of science and technology. The National Issues Forum (NIF) methodology was employed as tool to overcome these problems of deliberation in rural Kentucky. naturalistic evaluation model was used to critique the application of NIF in rural settings. The ten lessons learned contain insights about the problems, successes and the limitations associated with the NIF methodology for stimulating deliberation. \n URL \xc2\xa0 http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15575339609489807 \n Keywords \xc2\xa0Public deliberation,National Issues Forum, hyper individualism, \xc2\xa0public dialogue \n Target Audiences \xc2\xa0Extension professionals \n\t \n\t\n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t Leave comment \t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Tips for Talking about Race \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\t\t April 10, 2017 Extension Professionals Fact Sheet University professionals facilitation race Rachel Welborn \t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n\n\t\t \n\t\t Contact \xc2\xa0Division of Inclusion, Diversity and Equity, University of Missouri,\xc2\xa0diversity@missouri.edu \n Description \xc2\xa0This 3-page document provides strategies for thoughtfully engaging in conversations about race. \n URL \xc2\xa0 https://diversity.missouri.edu/education/handouts/talk-about-race.pdf \n Keywords: \xc2\xa0Facilitation, race \n Target Audiences: \xc2\xa0Academicians, university personnel, Extension professionals \n\t \n\t\n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t Leave comment \t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t The Language of Identity \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\t\t April 10, 2017 Community Extension Professionals Fact Sheet Individuals bias diversity inclusion language word choice Rachel Welborn \t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n\n\t\t \n\t\t Contact \xc2\xa0Division of Inclusion, Diversity and Equity, University of Missouri,\xc2\xa0diversity@missouri.edu \n Description \xc2\xa0Words can significantly impact our interaction with others.

The five stages illustrate how conveners and community can move from launching deliberative work to implementation of specific strategies that address public issue. \n URL: \xc2\xa0 http://www.extension.umn.edu/community/civic-engagement/engage-citizens-decisions/docs/civic-engagement-ataglance.pdf \n Keywords: \xc2\xa0civic engagement, collaboration, discussion, reflection \n Target Audiences: \xc2\xa0community members, elected/appointed leaders \n\t \n\t\n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t Leave comment \t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Family Leadership Training Institute (FLTI) \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\t\t April 10, 2017 Community Curriculum or Guide Individuals civic engagement family leadership Rachel Welborn \t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n\n\t\t \n\t\t Contact: \xc2\xa0Kyle Christensen,\xc2\xa0kyle.christensen@colostate.edu \n Description \xc2\xa0The Family Leadership Training Institute (FLTI), located at Colorado State University, is public-private partnership that works with local communities to provide parents/youth/communities with the knowledge, skills and tools for civic engagement.

The team of experts will research several existing adaptive learning tools and consult with experts in the field of online learning who are currently implementing adaptive learning into their programming. They will design and deliver adaptive learning activities within existing online courses through several selected pilot projects. Project page \n Elevating of the Role of Spatial Reasoning in Communication and Decision Making in the Cooperative Extension System University of New Hampshire, Shane Bradt This project will empower CES staff to create interactive, online maps to collect and share spatial information, as well as, tell compelling stories. It will provide CES staff and administrators with access to relevant spatial data layers (i.e., census, political boundaries, watersheds, natural features) for their geographic region. It will advise Communities of Practice (CoP) and Learning Networks (LN) in the effective use of geospatial technologies in projects and grants. Project page \n Extending Reality: Instant Access to Extension Resources Using Augmented Reality Innovations University of Tennessee, Heather Wallace and Emily Tipton This project will explore Augmented Reality (AR) to engage consumers in manner that will revolutionize daily life and transform research-based information access. This project is an innovation incubator to test augmented reality in consumers\xe2\x80\x99 daily lives and will serve as pilot in development and use of augmented reality software and existing content from eXtension and land grant institutions. While virtual reality \xe2\x80\x9ctests\xe2\x80\x9d possible scenarios, augmented reality applies solutions in real-time by projecting layers of data onto real world environments, creating deeper and more meaningful experiences for users. Project page \n eXtension Geo-Citizens Design Forest Farms Virginia Tech, John Munsell This project accelerates Cooperative Extension\xe2\x80\x99s use of virtual high performance GeoDesign computing to improve the precision of farming systems in changing climate. The project advances Cooperative Extension citizen science 2.0 by bringing programmers, geospatial experts, land management specialists, and citizen scientists together in customizable, collaborative, and convivial virtual workspace to create precision agriculture computer application. The project enhances flipped and interactive Cooperative Extension remote training methods over broad geographical regions through novel synthesis of videography and problem solving scenarios. The project strengthens Cooperative Extension inclusivity with multi-institution, multi-state physiographic data collection and aggregation partnership. The project also demonstrates lasting NEW eXtension partnerships where computer simulation supports land use precision and citizens support computer simulation. Project page \n Lighting the Education Fire with Virtual Environments and Oculus Rift Technology University of Idaho, Joey Peutz,\xc2\xa0Brian Cleveley and Lori Wahl This project proposes to extend Cooperative Extensions\xe2\x80\x99 outreach via 24/7 public experiential learning tools using the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, web browser-based virtual environment (single and multi-user) and an app accessed through mobile devices supporting 3D virtual worlds. The primary demonstration project is simulation to learn about home safety when threatened by wildfire. The project offers the opportunity to experience wildfire safety experience as an immersive 3D simulation with participants customizing the experience variables. The ability to access the same simulation content across three different platforms is also new way of delivering knowledge making it more flexible and adaptable to meet the changing needs of Extension and their constituents. Project page \n Track that Crop: Mobile App to Aggregate Crop Variety Data in Alaska and Beyond and to Increase Citizen Engagement with Cooperative Extension Service University of Alaska, Heidi Rader This project will create mobile app to conduct citizen agriculture research. Alaska Master Gardeners will help test the app followed by recruiting additional citizen scientists statewide and nationally. Extension\xe2\x80\x99s roots are in \xe2\x80\x9cextending\xe2\x80\x9d research-based information to the public. This project turns this traditional model upside down by asking the public to conduct and share research (also known as citizen science). The project proposes developing mobile app to aggregate location-based crop variety research conducted by Master Gardeners, gardeners, and farmers. Project page \n NeXT Talks: Igniting Innovation in Extending Knowledge Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Extension, Holly Whitaker This project expands platform designed to inspire innovation in Cooperative Extension program delivery by quickly connecting educators to material on emerging topics. These \xe2\x80\x9ctalks\xe2\x80\x9d are timely, proactive, interactive and position educators nationwide with information to position them as front line resources in their communities. Using streaming video and social media, NeXT Talks allow audience members to engage with subject matter specialists within and outside the land grant system. Project page \n Spark Lab Innovation Center Ohio State University, Mark Light This project will instill that inspiration or \xe2\x80\x9cspark\xe2\x80\x9d that youth and adults need to learn, discover, and grow in creative environment. This goes beyond just setting up \xe2\x80\x9cmakerspace\xe2\x80\x9d. It will be an overall center of innovation framed through the education lens of land grant university system. This project will transform local Extension office beyond the traditional into the innovative by bringing entrepreneurship, university education opportunities, and technology and maker space together in dynamic and still to be explored relationship. The project will connect local businesses, residents, and educators to promote innovation, learning, and creativity in hands-on space. It will also create physical space model that can be reproduced by Extension in other states nationwide. Project page \n Virtual Communication Camp North Dakota State University, Becky Koch and Bob Bertsch This project will prepare educator teams to focus on key messages and use innovative communication skills to plan communication strategy to help bring about behavior change.

No, but it is the place to start. This blog post is to share journey and belief that when we are responsible for providing food to share with community members it brings that community, as well as individuals, level of satisfaction. \n \n When individuals from diverse backgrounds, diverse cultures, and diverse communities are satisfied, how does it affect the health and well-being of those communities? Community well-being includes the social, economic, environmental, cultural, and political conditions of individuals to fulfill their potential. \n Contributors to project of bringing farming to Utica are community-based and interested in community gardening and share similar vision: that if we provide the education, support, and have community \xc2\xa0commitment to farm in the city, it will provide the first steps for community members\xe2\x80\x99 satisfaction and well-being. \n \n Utica is one of two cities located in central New York in Oneida County. Our county is rich and diverse in agriculture. \xc2\xa0According to demographic report from Headwaters Economic Profile System https://headwaterseconomics.org/tools/economic-profile-system/ ), Utica\xe2\x80\x99s population was 61,628 in 2015. The population demographic is: \xc2\xa0Whites, 59.8%, African Americans, 14.7%, Asian Americans, 9.9%, and Hispanics or Latinos,11.4% with the balance made up of refugees. \xc2\xa0The largest groups ever resettled to Utica include Bosnian, Burmese, individuals from the former Soviet Union, and Vietnamese https://www.mvrcr.org/about/populations/ \n One refugee said, \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThere is this kind of depression. \xc2\xa0Everyone was dreaming to come to the U.S.A., but they were not happy. The people were put in apartments, missing activity, community. They were bored. They were homesick for traditional food, grown by hand, and many of the residents live at or below the poverty level.\xe2\x80\x9d \n Utica has 32.2% of its population below the poverty line. Poverty is an important indicator of economic well-being. Individuals with limited income may have different values and attitudes as they related to their communities. \n \n Fundamentally, community gardening is shared endeavor providing opportunities for members to improve their environments and/or produce fruit and vegetables for food. \xc2\xa0Community gardens have potential to improve nutritional status, increase physical activity, play role in reducing stress and promote better mental health all while contributing to an enhanced quality of life for those involved. \n Our project\xe2\x80\x99s mission is to contribute to the evidence base that first-hand gardening activities play role in increased level of satisfaction both in individuals, as well as in their community. \n Our next blog post will define the participants, define our partners and the types of quantitative and qualitative studies we will be conducting. \xc2\xa0 \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n Did you like this article?

Do you want to learn who else is programming in this area so that you can learn from or collaborate with them? Perhaps you already are leading program but may be feeling alone in your efforts. \n With the help of new\xc2\xa0 national database of sustainability-focused Extension programs connecting or getting inspired is made easy! Simply visit the database and discover over 170 entries with 41 states represented. Extension programs range from New York&#8217;s Consumer Education Program for Residential Energy Efficiency to New Mexico&#8217;s Master Composters program to Mississippi\xe2\x80\x99s Sustainable Bioproducts Initiative. \n \n All entries in the database fall into one or more of the following categories: \n \n Land (landfill and conservation issues) \n Air (quality and climate change) \n Food (sustainable and local food systems) \n Water (quality and conservation) \n Energy (efficiency and renewable). \n \n In building the database, all states were contacted, sometimes several times. However, it is possible some programs were missed. If you do not see your program represented and would like to add it, there is an easy form that you can complete. \n This project was made possible with funding provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture:\xc2\xa0 National Institute of Food and Agriculture the\xc2\xa0 National Network for Sustainable Living Education \xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0 Utah State University (USU) Extension Sustainability States were contacted and entries were formatted by USU Extension Sustainability intern Claire Core and associate professor Roslynn Brain. \n To connect with other Extension professionals working on sustainability, visit the National Network for Sustainable Living Education \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n Did you like this article?

Dr. Carol Henderson spoke about our responsibility to making sure youth get quality educational experience. She said it takes all of us to cultivate that experience. would like to take that step forward, because believe this goes beyond the classroom. believe as professionals it is up to all of us us to cultivate the experience we have in our workplace. \n Dr. Tony Allen speaking at UD Diversity Summit (Photo Credit: Christy Mannering) \n During Dr. Tony Allen&#8217;s remarks, he said, &#8220;We all have responsibility to serve as we have been served. None of us white, black, brown, gay or straight, male or female, have gotten to any of our positions or any of our places in life, alone.&#8221; The truth is that whether we notice and acknowledge each other or not, we still all play role in each others lives. The way we live, the way we work, the way we present ourselves, our action and our inaction can very much impact and shape the lives of the people around us. \n We impact and shape the lives of the people around us.\xc2\xa0 moment of clarity during the event realized how this connected with the idea of developing emotional intelligence in the workplace. If you&#8217;re stressed, overwhelmed or frustrated and you are unable to self-regulate that could negatively impact your work environment (Deleon, 2015). Our technical skills, our expertise and knowledge won&#8217;t matter if we are unable to effectively work with others. Emotions often prompt the way we behave and react. Our emotions influence the type of leader we are and how we learn from constructive criticism. \n Emotional intelligence goes beyond self-awareness and self-regulation. Are we able to look through the lens of other people? Can we look through the lens of different backgrounds including age, culture, race and ability? To promote diversity and be inclusive we need to be aware of ourselves, aware of our peers and that includes colleagues outside our work &#8220;silos&#8221;. Being more in tune to each other will help us to provide better service to those we work with in the public and better workplace experience. \n Sources: \n Deleon, Mariah.

OSU 4H publication 372. \n E-books are old hat. Right? There are numerous platforms upon which one may design, write, and offer content. But do these mash-up with your university\xe2\x80\x99s (or organization\xe2\x80\x99s) server? Do you need permission? Or do you go rogue (using different system)? \n Here at Ohio State, our \xe2\x80\x9cOnline Project Book\xe2\x80\x9d team left the Feb. 2017 eXtension Diversity &amp; Inclusion Issue Corps meeting with great excitement. With the help (and inspiration) of experts and colleagues from around the country, we successfully developed an initial content layout plan and began the design formation phase. \n Our aim was simple: translating print version of 4-H Diversity project book to an interactive, online option. use \xe2\x80\x9ctranslate\xe2\x80\x9d purposely. We did not wish to simply transfer content. (That could be boring online!) Instead, we wanted to translate the spirit of the readings and activities into an interactive, online book that would engage and (hopefully) inspire. \n Sound easy enough? Well\xe2\x80\xa6 \n Our main challenges began with the platform. OSU uses different systems (sometimes depending on what college your department is housed in). Then, there were permission issues. Some team members could not access the content that others had begun. What we thought would be an easy online sharing process turned out to cause quite delay in progress. \n So what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done? \n Start early! But mostly, involve your technical peeps. They can help you avoid platform and permission issues BEFORE they happen. Also, look for non-team members who may have interests in your topic or expertise in design and delivery. They can be life-savers, contributing both small and large ideas that propel you forward. Lastly, look for students or interns that might be available to assist. We got very lucky in finding some free student hours. It moved our project forward\xe2\x80\xa6 and perhaps more importantly, gave her very nice resume item! \n We continue moving ahead and look forward to the launch. \n Brian Raison, Jo Williams, Jane Wright \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n Did you like this article?

Who is working on water quality or drought mitigation? Who is solving problems of food deserts? What resources are used to support these Extension programs? What can educators and researchers learn from others who are working in similar areas? How is research intertwined in these programs? \n Cooperative Extension professionals and Extension\xe2\x80\x99s federal partners ask similar questions &#8211; and it\xe2\x80\x99s not always easy or swift to answer these questions beyond state and regional boundaries. Having access to other programs, resources, and the people who are successful in creating and conducting Extension programs could hasten Extension\xe2\x80\x99s national progress by sparking and accelerating the spread of innovation within the system \n Currently, we are working on Knowledge Network to link Land-Grant University researchers and Cooperative Extension educators, their work, and their resources. The network directory will assist USDA, Extension and Land-Grant professionals, educators, and researchers to discover and connect with each other, resources, and programs. It will highlight and link to key Extension system assets (e.g. people, white papers, journal articles, courses, presentations, posters, data, toolkits, and decision making tools). \n goal is more connected Cooperative Extension workforce that is able to constructively participate in and facilitate in online and offline conversations that lead to personal and professional learning and to better local programming. There is no need for central unit to host the work of the system but rather system that enables discovery of Extension work by smartly linking to the work through an easy-to-use mobile interface. Our first pilot will include an e-book interface. \n We are collaborating with Matthew Lange of IC -FOODS of the University of California to develop an ontology(ies) creating common language so topics can be sorted and discovered much like the way libraries use keywords to describe books and journal articles. Potentially, for any given program, national presence can be built and Extension educators and others can generatively build their programs. \n Jeff Piestrak investigative fellowship provided vision of land grant knowledge network to serve as useful national resource. The development of knowledge network is also informed by Christian Schmieder&#8217;s and Justin Smith\xe2\x80\x99s eXtension Fellowships. Christian demonstrated ways to analyze large quantities of Extension impact data Justin is testing and demonstrating protocols, making eXtension and Extension information more open, accessible and linked to open research and data. \n Our goal is to have proof of concept of this knowledge network before the end of 2017. \xc2\xa0 We will demonstrate the possibilities of connecting varied and distributed body of data and information resources and expertise, including presentations, formal and informal articles and online dialogues, and extension.org resource articles. Our first demonstration project will support the Food Systems Impact Collaborative. \n Please comment on this article or send your comments and ideas to aadrian@extension.org \n Graphic is taken from Pixabay \xc2\xa0(public domain) \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n Did you like this article?

This was done during an Earth Day event that also featured native bee exhibit by Colorado State Beekeepers Association, native bee habitat building activity and pollinator plant talk by Pueblo Master Gardeners. It also included beekeeping equipment demo by Pueblo County Beekeepers Association. short presentation about the BeeWise project and the successful funding of BeeWise through several distinguished grants were delivered to the engaged audience. \n BeeWise also participated in pollinator events in June during Colorado Pollinator Month, hosting booth at local farmers\xe2\x80\x99 market where top-bar honey bee exhibit was on display with honey bee and native bee specimens. pheromone game using essential oils was played with children to demonstrate how honey bees communicate using pheromones. \n The prototyping has been partially completed for smart hive kit, using Raspberry Pi and sensors donated from Spark Fun (more on that in future posts). Summer camps (also in future post) have started and we have identified candidate for paid Maker/Beekeeper position. The project has even gotten its own logo (see image, right). \n hiring panel made up of CSU-Extension office staff, 4-H leaders, an AmeriCorps Service Member, and the Makerspace Librarian at the local library, held interviews for the Maker/Beekeeper position. We identified person to fill the position who will assist with the final build of the kits and lessons for using the smart hive, maintaining the BeeWise Apiary, and outreach to local youth through school enrichment and summer camps, demonstrating the kit and teaching pollination programs. \n Partnerships and collaboration have really driven the success of this program.

The first session was held June 5-9, 2017 with enrollment limited to 10 youth ages 8-13 for each session. The Pueblo City and County Zoo hosts the 4-H STEAM Pueblo Apiary and provides space for our summer camps and family friendly pollinator maker series. Several 4-H youth and 4-H Leaders who have volunteered for the camps. The second session of BeeWise Summer Camp was held July 17-21, 2017 at the Pueblo Zoo, and the third session was held August 7-11, 2017. The camps have been huge success and have been completely full each session. \n Figure 1. BeeWise Session 1: June 5-9, 2017 \n BeeWise summer camp is full of fun and discovery, as youth dissect flowers when they learn about pollination, play the waggle dance game when learning about honey bee navigation, and identify honey bee classes (queen, drone, worker) from the safety of their beekeeping suits. The first session of camp was special because the youth got to help install the weather station and learn about all the functions of the station and how it works and collects data. The youth also engage with the art of beekeeping from honey extraction to candle and lip balm making. \n This camp provides 15 contact hours of STEM learning focused on engaging students in learning by doing and project based learning. We also engage the Maker aspect, as kids help make frames for the hive or help do some task for the apiary that needs to be done.\xc2\xa0 They also get to make BeeWise button that they can wear on their shirt or hat. \n After the summer, we plan to demonstrate the smart hive at the Pueblo Mini Maker Faire in late October. We hope to have the project built out into full kit by early spring so we can implement few kits at local schools and community spaces in spring of 2018. \n To learn more about BeeWise, visit the project page or contact Jane Crayton at craytonj@pueblocounty.us \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n Did you like this article?

It is important to know the hives humidity and temperature along with weight. This provides information that can be used to schedule feeding cycles or added winterizing. Gathered by analog and digital sensors the hive data can be transmitted by microprocessor and made available on the web, allowing beekeepers around the clock access to hive stats. \n Phase 2: Identify Technologies \n Next, we identified technologies and open source Internet of Things (IoT) networks. There are several methods of monitoring and controlling data sources available on the Internet. The most common being .IO sites that connect to devices over the Internet. Some are open source and others have premium to connect and store data. With Wi-Fi connection collected hive information can be compared to other hive analytics. This can shed light on colony collapse disorder (CCD) by generating geographical footprint of hive health. \n Phase 3: Prototyping \n For the hardware, we conducted Raspberry Pi and Arduino Hardware prototyping and testing with software IoT dashboard connections. We established server connection and communication between devices. This allowed for the best compatibility and user experience. It also supports continued management and modification of the hive data collection processes for future applications.\xc2\xa0 The final phase of prototyping to test newly integrated technology for the second iteration of the project will be completed in fall of 2017. \n Technology Discovery \n Overview \n We have identified specific hardware and software we believe will work nicely for the project, and we will be moving into the final phase of prototyping this fall. We tested several different open source software options including, Cayenne, Ada Fruit (beta), Free Board. Cayenne is the only IO that is working with all the sensors. \n Finding the right library for the sensor has proven difficult as we had sensors from variety of vendors. We have found that we need to obtain more rugged sensors to probe into the hive, or we will need to 3D print some custom cages to protect the sensors. It may be easier to buy hat for the Raspberry Pi which is basically an expansion board with bunch of sensors already installed. \n Figure 1. Arduino UNO and Spark fun Temperature and Humidity Breadboard test connections \n \n Figure 2. Raspberry Pi 3B &#8211; Temperature and PRI Motion Sensor Breadboard test connection. \n \n Figure 3. Cayenne Remote Connection Interface \n \n Figure 4. BeeWise hive sensor data viewable in Cayenne \n \n Figure 5. BeeWise Pi &#8211; Mobile application display of data from hive sensors \n \n We built beehive sensor super to prototype sensor and microcontroller integration into the hive colony. We need to have proper ventilation for the electrical components without compromising the hive. \n Additionally, we identified an expanded lesson potential and cost reduction in the total kit by using Raspberry Pi weather station.\xc2\xa0 We need to test if the Pi can handle the sensors for the hive and the sensors for the weather station or if we need an additional Pi to run the weather hat. We need to test is the Pi weather station is as reliable as the Davis Weather Vantage Pro we currently have installed at the zoo in the apiary. \n We also took google earth image of the Apiary for location reference for the weather and sensor data when using the Cayenne IO. \n Equipment List \n Below is list of the technology used and tested so far, with list of options for additional sensor expansions. \n Microprocessor: Raspberry Pi 3B Wi-Fi \n OS System: Raspberry Pixel Debian Linux 8.0 Python \nPower supply (120 VAC to +5 VDC, 12 VDC to VDC USB converter) \n16 GB SD RAM card \n Rpi Options: \n Pi Sense Hat \nPi Weather Station \nPi Camera \n Microcontroller: Arduino Uno USB \n Sensors Options: \n Temperature/Humidity Sensor(s) \nLux Sensor \nRain Gauge \nSound \nGyroscope \nMotion \nCamera \n Scale: \nLoad cells \nLoad Cell Mounts (frame, rails, direct) \nFeet or rubber bumpers, metric bolts \n Other: \nWeatherproof enclosure for electronics. \nMounting hardware for boards and sensors. \nPower (AC, Battery/Solar) \nInternet (Ethernet, WiFi, Cell Phone Hot Spot) \n Open source io: \n \n https://io.adafruit.com \n https://mydevices.com \n https://freeboard.io \n http://app.beekeeping.io \n \n Tech Hardware Resources: \n \n https://www.adafruit.com \n https://www.sparkfun.com \n https://www.raspberrypi.org \n \n Research Resources: \n HiveTool Hard Ware list open source software &#8211; \n \n http://hivetool.org/w/index.php?title=HiveTool.org \n http://hivetool.org/w/index.php?title=Hardware:_Overview \n \n BeeMonitor The hardware is Arduino Raspberry Pi and the app is open source &#8211; \n \n https://beemonitor.org/setup/ \n https://emoncms.org \n http://emoncms.org/beehive/live \n \n HACKADAY Article Arduino base &#8211; https://hackaday.io/project/2453-arduino-beehive-monitor \n Git hub &#8211; https://github.com/exmonkey206/beehive_monitor \n Makezine Article &#8211; \xc2\xa0they have list of hardware hacks http://makezine.com/projects/bees-sensors-monitor-hive-health/ \n Special thanks to SparkFun for the prototyping hardware to get this project started! \n For more information on the smart beehive, contact Jane Crayton at craytonj@pueblocounty.us \n \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n Did you like this article?

Because Extension is in every state and in most counties, we are equipped to grow this movement into more rural communities. The 4-H motto, \xe2\x80\x9cmaking the best better,\xe2\x80\x9d includes the word \xe2\x80\x9cmaking\xe2\x80\x9d. Extension has history of hands-on learning and making for over 100 years, so we are primed to connect with these new audiences of makers. As the outreach arm of the University, Extension has an opportunity to not only provide access to information like it has for more than 100 years, but also to showcase through the maker movement the hands-on education we have been facilitating for years through 4-H. 4-H Making Festivals will combine the best of the maker movement with hands-on-learning. Extension staff will plan and implement five festivals in fall 2017 and spring of 2018. These will include youth from the STEM-focused 4-H Tech Wizards after-school program. These festivals will be replicated across the nation and at additional sites in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Indiana. \n 4-H Making Festivals will combine the best of the maker movement with hands-on-learning.

This project is an innovation incubator to test augmented reality in consumers\xe2\x80\x99 daily lives and will serve as pilot in development and use of augmented reality software and existing content from eXtension and land grant institutions. While virtual reality \xe2\x80\x9ctests\xe2\x80\x9d possible scenarios, augmented reality applies solutions in real-time by projecting layers of data onto real world environments, creating deeper and more meaningful experiences for users. \n \n \n \n \n Project Updates: \n Apple iPad devices, combined with iOS app Layar, are key components to this project as they will serve as the vehicle for creating Augmented Reality (AR) experiences for users. The iOS devices will be deployed into counties across Tennessee to test this technology in the hands of Extension agents. Each device will be managed remotely using cloud-based Mobile Device Management (MDM) software known as Cisco Meraki. Meraki MDM enables IT administrators to implement new apps and settings for AR testing as well as manage and troubleshoot issues with the devices from the cloud. Augmented Reality apps, such as Layar, will permit state-level specialists to extend the shelf-life of traditional print publications by adding the option of updating the digital AR experiences that are attached to the static content as desired.

Pueblo has large agricultural community and there is growing interest in beekeeping. The BeeWise program will engage these new beekeepers with the technology and education to successfully manage their apiaries. Several schools with FFA programs have discussed housing their own bee colonies and participating in camps and special programs. \n Additionally, the BeeWise program aims to educate the general public on pollinators through strategic placement of hives at the Pueblo Zoo and the Pueblo County Courthouse which will highlight the importance of pollinators by using data that is collected from the apiaries. This will allow the public to interact with the apiary locally using an iPad Kiosk or the internet. Professional development opportunities will be available for other Agents, Zookeepers, and Teachers at FFA program. \n \n \n \n \n Project Updates: \n \n Bees installed in southern Colorado&#8217;s first smart hive \n \n \n \n \n \n Publications, Outputs \n \n \n Bee Wise Camps (2017) \n [blog] BeeWise Is Buzzing Right Along \n [blog] BeeWise Summer Camps Full of Fun and Discovery \n [blog] Building Smart Beehive \n \n \n \n \n \n Social Links: \n \n Facebook &#8211; STEAM Pueblo \n Email &#8211; craytonj@pueblocounty.us \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n Did you like this article?

If you work somewhere on the food systems spectrum and are excited about innovative approaches that make visible difference at the local level, this program is for you. Our goal for the 2017 eXtension Impact Collaborative for Food Systems is to identify 225 projects and work with around 700 Extension professionals and their partners. \n The Impact Collaborative is the new name for the Issue Corps The Collaborative catalyzes the work of innovative Extension Professionals by supporting their efforts in several ways: \n \n Organizing Designathon event to introduce design thinking and concept mapping to program planning \n Providing access to mentoring from key informants in topics relevant to Impact Collaborative projects \n Offering professional development around topics selected by Collaborative members \n Amplifying Collaborative members&#8217; efforts by sharing their work at national level to foster adoption of evidence-based approaches and practices throughout the Cooperative Extension System \n \n This support, along with the dynamic synergy from interacting and networking with other Extension Professionals is designed to accelerate the adoption of innovation in local programming. \n Timeline \n The organizing committee will develop and release the call for applications this spring (2017). Professional development will begin in the summer with the Designathon planned for winter. Professional development, key informant mentoring, and building the knowledge base on evidence-based practices will continue after the Designathon. \n To be sure to receive announcements when the call for applications is released, you need to be on the eXtension mailing list. If you do not already have an eXtension ID, visit the People site and signup \n Issue Corps members must be part of an eXtension member institution. Review the list of current members to verify the membership status of your institution. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n Did you like this article?

The projects are listed below in alphabetical order of the principal investigator. \n Empowering the Cooperative Extension System to make decisions with spatial data using the National Extension Web-mapping Tool \n Shane Bradt, University of New Hampshire \n The goal of the National Extension Web-mapping Tool (NEWT), created during previous eXtension Innovation grant is to increase the effective use of spatial data to make strategic decisions regarding planning and programming in the Cooperative Extension System (CES). NEWT is not simply way to add data layers to map, but instead is straightforward online tool for exploring spatial data relevant to CES in the ways which CES staff and administrators find useful, including maps, tables, and graphs. \n Once NEWT is released publicly in late spring 2017, this Innovation Grant will focus on promoting NEWT throughout CES, offering professional development on the use of NEWT, and gathering feedback regarding the current version, including ideas regarding new functions and datasets which could further broaden the use of NEWT. Visit the project page \n BeeWise: 4-H STEAM Pueblo project to create Internet of Things beehives to collect and analyze data for citizen science \n Jane Crayton, Colorado State University \n BeeWise aims to create robust beekeeping program which integrates quality STEM education with Maker Ed, Internet of Things (IoT), and Citizen Science. Pueblo has large agricultural community and there is growing interest in beekeeping. The BeeWise program will engage these new beekeepers with the technology and education to successfully manage their apiaries. Several schools with FFA programs have discussed housing their own bee colonies and participating in camps and special programs. \n Additionally, the BeeWise program aims to educate the general public on pollinators through strategic placement of hives at the Pueblo Zoo and the Pueblo County Courthouse which will highlight the importance of pollinators by using data that is collected from the apiaries. This will allow the public to interact with the apiary locally using an iPad Kiosk or the internet. Professional development opportunities will be available for other Agents, Zookeepers, and Teachers at FFA program. Visit the project page \n 4-H BioBand Fitness Tracker to Combine Maker Education, Data Science, Fitness, and Wearable Tech \n Robert Horton, The Ohio State University \n The project features first-of-its-kind 4-H BioBand Fitness Tracker kit with Arduino microcontroller connecting heart rate, physical activity, and temperature with capabilities of operating within the structure of the internet. The 4-H BioBand Fitness Tracker is expected to generate large amounts of data from the various sensors, thereby increasing the necessity for quick aggregation of the data, and an increase in the need to index, store, and process such data more effectively. Overall, the project team envisions demystifying for youth the basic principles of technology design and data collection that can then be utilized and applied as Data Scientists to examine their own fitness behavior, customize their Bio-Band\xe2\x80\x99s data input to fit their physical profile, and compare their experiences with greater community of users. Visit the project page \n \n Expansion of 4-H Ohio pilot-tested Maker Festivals and Tech Wizards to rural areas in multiple states \n Mark Light, The Ohio State University \n In 2006, the first Maker Faire was started in the San Francisco Bay area for makers to share with each other in public venue. Because Extension is in every state and in most counties, we are equipped to grow this movement into more rural communities. The 4-H motto, \xe2\x80\x9cmaking the best better,\xe2\x80\x9d includes the word \xe2\x80\x9cmaking\xe2\x80\x9d. Extension has history of hands-on learning and making for over 100 years, so we are primed to connect with these new audiences of makers. As the outreach arm of the University, Extension has an opportunity to not only provide access to information like it has for more than 100 years, but also to showcase through the maker movement the hands-on education we have been facilitating for years through 4-H. 4-H Making Festivals will combine the best of the maker movement with hands-on-learning. Extension staff will plan and implement five festivals in fall 2017 and spring of 2018. These will include youth from the STEM-focused 4-H Tech Wizards after-school program. These festivals will be replicated across the nation and at additional sites in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Indiana. \n 4-H Making Festivals will combine the best of the maker movement with hands-on-learning.

The small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) regulatory landscape changed dramatically with the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s revisions that took place over the summer, 2016. As result of these regulatory changes, Virginia Cooperative Extension (VCE) has been developing in-house expertise to support sUAS applications across program areas to support an array of needs by managers and producers. Precision agriculture is one of these potential application areas. \n Based on findings from this project, VCE agents and specialists, as well as other stakeholders, will better understand some of the limitations, challenges, and benefits associated with the use of sUAS to support agricultural management.

Extension\xe2\x80\x99s roots are in \xe2\x80\x9cextending\xe2\x80\x9d research-based information to the public. This project turns this traditional model upside down by asking the public to conduct and share research (also known as citizen science). The project proposes developing mobile app to aggregate location-based crop variety research conducted by Master Gardeners, gardeners, and farmers. \n \n \n \n \n Project Updates: \n The Grow &amp; Tell app has been released (March 2017).\xc2\xa0 The app crowdsources recommendations on vegetable varieties so that gardeners can see what grows best in their area. The app helps people in areas where vegetable variety trials may not be applicable.

This investment has built the only national network in the Land Grant University System that uses proven process to accelerate capacity for projects with problem-solving teams so that significant local change happens. See the Impact Collaborative story. \n \n In 2017-2018, the eXtension Foundation with the Cooperative Extension System (CES) is planning to bring together nearly 2,000 CES professionals and their community partners into multi-themed Impact Collaborative\xc2\xa0experiences to develop and strengthen local impact in behavioral health, food systems, diversity &amp; inclusion, and regionally-focused themes to be determined with partners. Our goal is to work with 15-35 Impact Collaborative\xc2\xa0members at each eXtension Foundation member institution in 2017-2018. \n Impact Collaborative\xc2\xa0Background \n Since early \xc2\xa02016 eXtension\xc2\xa0has successfully engaged hundreds of \xc2\xa0Cooperative Extension professionals in the development of impactful projects addressing topics such as local food systems, climate, small business development, enhancing rural capacity, equine biosecurity, financial management, backyard poultry, women in agriculture and diversity and inclusion. These efforts were part of the eXtension Issue Corps program. \xc2\xa0In 2017, the eXtension Foundation rebranded the Issue Corps as the Impact Collaborative \n The Impact Collaborative members reported working differently as result, including: \n \n 93% believed the Impact Collaborative\xc2\xa0participation was positive experience. \n 86% gained awareness of, access to, or training in the use of new tools. \n 83% were exposed to new or different ideas and/or viewpoints. \n 82% interacted with other Extension professionals outside their normal professional circle \n 68% feel they can influence either their institution and/or their professional field in new ways after participating in the Impact Collaborative. \n The majority reported improved ability to participate in professional discussions, developed confidence in sharing resources, gained comfort in recommending alternate approaches to ideas, and are working differently because of their Impact Collaborative\xc2\xa0participation \n \n The Impact Collaborative Process \n The Impact Collaborative\xc2\xa0is constructed around four essential elements: Design thinking, key informant\xc2\xa0expertise, growing base of evidence-based practice and dynamic synergy that happens\xc2\xa0when colleagues passionate about solving the same issues network face-to-face and online. \n \n Access to Key Informants \n Key Informant is recognized expert from either land-grant university, non-profit organization, or private industry, willing to share the latest research and innovations in Extension and related practice to help Collaborative members accelerate their project impact and scale. Key Informants include our cadre of eXtension Fellows funded in partnership with organizations such as USDA-NIFA, Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN), Digital Green and organizations of the Joint Council for Extension Professionals (JCEP). Locally-identified and willing Key Informants are also critical part of the Impact Collaborative process. \n Design Thinking \n \n The catalyzing event in the Impact Collaborative process is face-to-face Designathon. This 1.5-day event is focused on critically examining the structure of each project including: understanding local needs; identifying research and existing evidence-based programs and practices to meet that need, concept mapping the project&#8217;s attributes and elements; and identifying gaps and opportunities for greater impact and greater scale. This work is done in consultation with Key Informants to incorporate the latest relevant research and innovations. The Designathon aids Collaborative\xc2\xa0members and their projects by providing education and skill building tailored to specific needs, leveraging resources by networking and forming partnerships, and leveraging innovative approaches and processes to generate new resources needed to fulfill project goals. \xc2\xa0 \n Dynamic Networking Synergy \n While there are myriad conferences that focus on professional development, an eXtension Designathon takes action toward creating greater measurable, visible local impact by local community Extension educators and agents. Designing project as part of the Impact Collaborative\xc2\xa0empowers, advances, and accelerates results. Bringing like minds together to network creates synergy of creativity, innovation, and success. Collaborative\xc2\xa0alumni attest to enhanced project outcomes, the creation of new social and professional networks, and dynamic relationships that create systemic change in how Cooperative Extension professionals address local problems. \n Growing Evidence Base \n The Impact Collaborative experience is designed to foster the evidence of local impact and to document solutions that work in way that can be shared across the Extension system. Throughout the process, eXtension provides access to Key Informants and other critical eXtension tools and resources while projects move from preparation to implementation to impact. As we begin to learn from our first cohorts in 2016&#8230;results happen!

Following are the 2016 eXtension Foundation Fellows, their projects, and the focus of their plans. \n Seventh Annual eXtension Fellows \n Dave Francis, Extension Associate Professor, Utah State University \n \xe2\x80\x9c Maker Movement, Horticulture Fusion \xe2\x80\x9d \n Within the Maker Movement, there is new trend developing with tie to agriculture and gardening. Known as \xe2\x80\x9cgeek gardening,\xe2\x80\x9d it refers to gardening enhanced with technology-focused methods to increase the production of plant products or to solve issues such as irrigation or pest control. Geek gardening is of particularly attractive to gardening enthusiasts interested in local, small-scale agriculture and growing in small urban environments. related interest among these makers is \xe2\x80\x9cslow tools\xe2\x80\x9d&#8211;appropriately scaled, lightweight, affordable and open-source tools for small-scale farmers. The focus of Dave\xe2\x80\x99s work will be to identify and showcase variety of innovators, projects and solutions in the geek gardening arena and, using eXtension\xe2\x80\x99s outreach technologies, to introduce their innovations to gardening enthusiasts and small-acreage producers&#8211;and also to tech enthusiasts to encourage them to turn their hand to horticulture topics. Project Page \n Daphne Richards, County Agent and Educator, Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Extension Service \n \xe2\x80\x9cExpediting Social Media Campaign Management with Evergreen Content Development and Distribution\xe2\x80\x9d \n By now, most Cooperative Extension professionals have tried one or more social media platforms to promote programs or share educational content. Many have also created videos, infographics, webinars, and more. Each project is surprisingly time-consuming, requiring strategic planning, content development, project management, posting and curating. What is mounting up in Extension is good deal of duplication of offerings on both emerging issues and timeless topics that could be addressed with single video or infographic designed to be \xe2\x80\x9cevergreen\xe2\x80\x9d and applicable to broad geographic area. Daphne\xe2\x80\x99s project is to investigate topics ripe for creation from an \xe2\x80\x9cevergreen-content\xe2\x80\x9d perspective and create top-tips, how-to videos, seasonal advice and more to share with peers locally and, where applicable, regionally and nationally. \xc2\xa0She will also evaluate social media sharing platforms to help individuals and teams manage their posting of evergreen content via social media. \n Christian Schmieder, Qualitative Research Specialist and Lecturer, University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension (Program Development and Evaluation Unit) \n \xe2\x80\x9c Responding to the \xe2\x80\x98Data Imperative\xe2\x80\x99 in Extension:\xc2\xa0 Developing National Online Qualitative Analysis and Analysis Software Learning Platform \xe2\x80\x9d \n Big Data is big challenge for Cooperative Extension and its partner organizations. Increasingly Extension is expected to produce strong, data-driven insights for variety of audiences from ever larger, more diverse and complex data sources. How are Extension institutions and professionals to build the capacity to analyze large to massive amounts of qualitative data on the national, regional, state and team level? At all four levels, large qualitative datasets exist in such forms as impact statements, annual reports, research reports, results narratives, and more. The challenge is not collecting the data, but analyzing it in consistent, methodologically and procedurally sound way that facilitates using it. Christian plans to assess the scalability of analysis-focused software training required to build proficiency among Extension professionals in using Qualitative Data Analysis Software to analyze large qualitative data sets. Building on the model developed in his unit at his home institution, University of Wisconsin, he proposes to develop working prototype for this training, including online materials and teaching modules that might be disseminated for national use. Project Page \n Laura Thompson, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Extension Educator, Cropping Systems and Agriculture Technologies \n \xe2\x80\x9c Data Visualization in Publications, Live Presentations, and Recorded Data Videos \xe2\x80\x9d \n The world of Big Data is exploding with our increasing ability to generate and collect data in all the sectors Cooperative Extension serves. In addition to the challenge of how to store and process this data, equally important is how to make it meaningful for Extension\xe2\x80\x99s many audiences. In short, how can data be distilled and presented so that the intended audience can interpret it, remember it, and apply it to change behavior. Data visualization tools are now available so most Extension professionals can develop the capacity to collect and process large quantities of data to produce effective charts, figures and graphics for their various audiences. Data visualization is an important skill to expand in Extension\xe2\x80\x99s toolset. Laura will focus on data visualization and presentation for written publications, oral presentations and recorded presentations and develop best practices, drawn from examples at her home institution, University of Nebraska, for dissemination throughout Extension through eXtension\xe2\x80\x99s technologies and professional development outreach capabilities. Project Page \n First eXtension/GODAN Fellow \n Justin G. Smith, Ph.D., Director, Mason County Extension and Assistant Professor, Community Economic Development, Washington State University \n \xe2\x80\x9c Unified Knowledge Translation Framework for Integrating Interdisciplinary Research and Scholarly Activity Related to Climate Resilience and Food Security. \xe2\x80\x9d \n For Cooperative Extension, growing Big Data challenge is the need to address issues supported by collective ability to organize, link, retrieve and translate cross-disciplinary data, research and action. Addressing this need requires that Extension begins the work NOW on shaping the next-generation information architecture for Extension professionals, partners, and the broader communities related to Extension work. Working with eXtension and GODAN leadership, Justin plans to develop prototype \xe2\x80\x9cUnified Knowledge Translation Framework\xe2\x80\x9d that will demonstrate model for integrating interdisciplinary research and scholarly activity related specifically to climate resilience and food security. By leveraging innovations in cognitive computing, open data, artificial/collective intelligence and more, he plans to develop general structure and formal technical specifications to inform designing semi-autonomous (self-labelling, self-organizing) metadata labeling and indexing/search API for Extension and GODAN partners. This work is first step toward developing metadata-labeling protocol and production-level indexing system that can organize and link relevant information from diverse domains of knowledge, institutions, and other sources for ultimate use by Cooperative Extension and its partners \n About the eXtension Fellowships Programs \n The eXtension Fellowship program is offered in partnership with USDA-NIFA and dedicated to developing projects on applied innovation in U.S. Cooperative Extension settings. The eXtension/GODAN Fellowship is offered through partnership with Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN) and it focuses on testing and demonstrating protocols, including the use of competency frameworks, to make eXtension and Extension information more open, accessible and linked to open research and data. \n For more information on the Fellows or eXtension Fellowship programs,please contact Jerry Thomas, Director of eXtension\xe2\x80\x99s Innovation Lab \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n Did you like this article?

The purpose of eXtension and its projects, teams, and futuring research is to help Cooperative Extension professionals make visible and measurable impacts by identifying, incubating, lifting up and fostering innovation to accelerate the adoption of innovation. \n The goal is to provide safe, structured venues for \xe2\x80\x9cexperimenters\xe2\x80\x9d to create and test new ideas. eXtension provides structure for them to share and to identify intersections among their efforts and ideas that suggest further opportunities. In short, we operate as dynamic liquid network that facilitates both focus and agility for participating experimenters. \n Fellowships and Innovation Grant Projects \n eXtension funds fellowships and innovation grant projects as part of our effort to identify and incubate innovation in the Cooperative Extension System. Recent fellowships have included topics such as knowledge networks, large-scale qualitative data analysis, citizen science, the Maker movement and much more. Learn more about the 2015 Fellows and the 2016 Fellows \n Innovation grants have been awarded to develop programs around topics like story mapping, smart beehives, 4-H Maker festivals, Bio-band fitness trackers for youth, drones for small farms, and others. Learn more about the 2016 innovation projects and the 2017 innovation projects \n Each initiative operates with contract that specifies the structure, timelines, goals, outputs, and intended impact. participants receive mentoring in defining the research, prototype development, adoption plans and other steps of the innovation process. Outputs might include presentations, demonstrations, reports, published papers, webinars, blog posts and other communications key to sharing ideas and advancing adoption. \n Connecting Extension Professionals and Innovation \n Helping Extension professionals work differently is one of the main goals of eXtension. The flagship program for this is the Impact Collaborative. This program seeks to help Extension professionals increase their visibility and measurable local impact. Learn more about the Impact Collaborative&#8230; \n The Ed Tech Learning Network is vehicle for connecting innovation-minded Extension professionals and empowering them to put technology to use in their programs. The EdTechLN hosts regular tweetups and offers weekly newsletter. The founders of the EdTechLN recently received the 2017 JCEP Award for Creative Excellence To date, 267 people have joined the network and 315 follow on Facebook. \n eXtension also sponsored the development of the New Media Consortium Horizon Report 2016-2021: Cooperative Extension Edition The report was compiled by 50-person expert panel. It will guide many of the future initiatives of eXtension with the goal of increasing the visible and measurable local impact of Extension professionals. \n Innovate events have been held in Oregon, Utah, and Ohio in 2017 with another to be held in Delaware. These events bring together Extension faculty and staff to focus on the creative process and empower them to work differently. The innovate events were pilot programs from which the lessons learned and feedback are being used to shape the Impact Collaborative process. \n \n Get Involved \n Be sure to watch for the call for proposals for the next Impact Collaborative (expected September 2017). Anyone at an eXtension member institution is eligible to apply. The call will be distributed to eXtension ID holders via email. Future Fellows and innovation grant will be selected from Impact Collaborative alumni. \n Join the EdTechLN to receive announcements about tweetups and the weekly newsletter. \n For more information about any of these programs, contact Jamie Seger jamieseger@extension.org or Paul Hill paul.hill@usu.edu ). \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n Did you like this article?

The small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) regulatory landscape changed dramatically with the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s revisions that took place over the summer, 2016. As result of these regulatory changes, Virginia Cooperative Extension (VCE) has been developing in-house expertise to support sUAS applications across program areas to support an array of needs by managers and producers. Precision agriculture is one of these potential application areas. \n Based on findings from this project, VCE agents and specialists, as well as other stakeholders, will better understand some of the limitations, challenges, and benefits associated with the use of sUAS to support agricultural management. Using this information, we will be able to refine future programming efforts that can be used to support agricultural producers not only across the state but in other regions of the U.S. and beyond. \n \n \n \n \n Project Updates: \n We traveled to the Southwest Virginia Agricultural Research and Extension Center and presented at their annual Forage Field Expo. We had great turnout with over 100 livestock producers. We held &#8216;drone overview&#8217; presentation, Q&amp;A session, poster presentation, and couple of small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) demonstrations. Based on feedback from our sUAS presentations this summer, producers do have an interest about sUAS and how/if this technology can support their needs. There is significant amount of interest in the potential of sUAS by cattle producers and by organizations that are supporting cattle producers. We are selecting producers for our pilot programs [August 2017]. \n Also of note, we have received some seed funding to develop short sUAS online tutorials.

Issue Corps members, selected from eXtension Foundation member institutions combine their talent, \xe2\x80\x9con-the-ground\xe2\x80\x9d knowledge, and energy to serve as volunteer innovators who participate in creating next-generation Cooperative Extension System tools for achieving increased impact. \n Climate and Food Systems 2016 Issue Corps \n In 2016, the first cohort of the Issue Corps focused on the issues of climate and food systems The members of this cohort represent Extension professionals who were already working on issues related to climate and food systems. They self-identified as having strong desire to work \xe2\x80\x9chands-on\xe2\x80\x9d to create new methods for addressing critical issues.\xc2\xa0126 corps members representing 70 projects were selected. Read about some of the successes of the Issue Corps&#8230; \n Community Issue Corps 2016 \n The second Issue Corps cohort focused on communities affiliated with eXtension, the Community Issue Corps Eight projects with 27 members participated in Designathon to develop concept maps and interact with key informants to refine their program plan. \n Diversity and Inclusion Issue Corps 2017 \n The third cohort of the Issue Corps is focused on diversity and inclusion and includes 39 projects with over 80 team members participating in Designathon and series of professional development activities.

He also works with variety of food systems groups and initiatives, including the eXtension Community, Local and Regional Food Systems CoP \n Jeff&#8217;s fellowship focused on digital assets (data and information), and systems for managing and sharing those within the context of community and regional food systems efforts. He is particularly interested in how we can move beyond simple dissemination models/designs of these systems (during an era when we are increasingly \xe2\x80\x9cdisintermediated\xe2\x80\x9d), toward ones that are better suited to social knowledge creation processes. What we\xe2\x80\x99re finding is that often wicked problems like hunger cannot be solved by treating them solely as technical \xe2\x80\x9cknowledge deficit\xe2\x80\x9d problem \xe2\x80\x93we must also acknowledge the social dimensions. Not doing so can actually make things worse.

Smith, PhD. is the Director of Mason County Extension and Assistant Professor, Community Economic Development, Washington State University. He is the first eXtension/GODAN Fellow. \n This fellowship is in special area of interest. Its purpose is to demonstrate methods for linking research and Extension information in support of learning and innovation. The Fellow, through participation in the GODAN network, will test and demonstrate protocols, including the use of competency frameworks, making eXtension and Extension information more open, accessible and linked to open research and data. \n Increasingly, Cooperative Extension and its partner organizations are expected to produce strong, data-driven insights for variety of audiences from Big Qualitative Data\xe2\x80\x93ever larger, more diverse and complex data sources. To meet this need, Extension needs to build capacity to analyze large amounts of qualitative data in consistent, methodologically sound way. Christian will assess the scalability of analysis-focused Qualitative Data Analysis Software training and develop working prototype for Extension, including online materials and teaching modules that might be disseminated for national use. \n \n \n \n \n Member Institution: \n Washington State University \n \n \n \n Location: \n Shelton, WA, USA \n \n \n \n \n Connect with Justin: \n \n Email \n LinkedIn \n Mason County Community &amp; Economic Development \n \n \n \n \n \n Blog Posts: \n \n \n Success Story Data Jams Breath Life Into Extension Reporting \n \n Webinars \n Final Report \n \n \n \n \n Related Links: \n \n \n \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n Did you like this article?

The primary demonstration project is simulation to learn about home safety when threatened by wildfire. The project offers the opportunity to experience wildfire safety experience as an immersive 3D simulation with participants customizing the experience variables. The ability to access the same simulation content across three different platforms is also new way of delivering knowledge making it more flexible and adaptable to meet the changing needs of Extension and their constituents. \n \n \n \n \n Project Updates: \n The Blaze computer simulation is now available at\xc2\xa0 securetheshelter.com Blaze is stand-alone wildfire preparedness computer simulation designed to educate participants about the wildfire risks of their home and community and what steps to take to reduce the risks of ignition. \n \n \n \n \n Related Links: \n Project Page &#8211; Users can learn more about the Blaze project and download files to experience Blaze using: \n \n Oculus Rift (Windows based) \n WebGL (run from browser) \n Standalone: Windows and Macintosh \n Android Mobile (tablet or phone) \n Google Cardboard (Android based) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n Did you like this article?

NEWT is not simply way to add data layers to map, but instead is straightforward online tool for exploring spatial data relevant to CES in the ways which CES staff and administrators find useful, including maps, tables, and graphs. \n Once NEWT is released publicly in late spring 2017, this Innovation Grant will focus on promoting NEWT throughout CES, offering professional development on the use of NEWT, and gathering feedback regarding the current version, including ideas regarding new functions and datasets which could further broaden the use of NEWT. \n \n \n \n \n Project Updates: \n \n The beta of the tool is about to be released (July 2017).

It is model suggesting that learners will engage with content in different ways. For example, some participants bring with them prior knowledge and would prefer to focus on the content they need to know rather than follow linear learning process. \n This goal of this project is to evaluate and pilot adaptive learning tools for future cooperative extension programming. The team of experts is researching several existing adaptive learning tools and consulting with experts in the field of online learning who are currently implementing adaptive learning into their programming. \n Specific objectives for this project include: \n \n \n Increasing knowledge of adaptive learning tools through research and collaboration with experts. Adaptive learning tools will be assessed and ranked based on potential use within CES programming. \n \n \n Designing and delivering adaptive learning activities within existing online courses through several selected pilot projects. \n \n \n Evaluating the effectiveness of the adaptive learning experiences. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Updates: \n \n significant contribution of this project was the ability to test new way of teaching online. Adaptive learning is an emerging concept in the field of online learning and especially new within CES programming. Through our work, we focused on testing adaptive learning experiences with several different tools. No matter what tool was selected it was important to have content, activities, and assessments which had strong ties to sound learning objectives. Based on this, Learning Objective Outline was created to aid in the development of an online course. This template is useful to an individual or team that is building an online course as it requires the user to associate all content within course to learning objective. To download this template for your own use go to Learning Objective Outline/Storyboard \n Through our pilot courses, we built adaptive activities and courses. The adaptive activities were created using Articulate Storyline. These activities were built to reinforce concepts within an online course. An example was created in the topic area of equine behavior: Adaptive Learning &#8211; Articulate/Storyline Example In this activity, users are guided along learning path based on their knowledge which is tested through series of assessments. To download the Articulate Storyline file go to Adaptive Articulate Storyline Template In another pilot we tested an adaptive platform, D2L LeaP, which presented participants in course with custom learning path based on pre-assessment. \xc2\xa0We asked participants to compare past learning experiences to the same content presented in an adaptive manner. Eighty participants completed the pilot. Results indicated 77% agreed/strongly agreed the adaptive format was helpful in mastering content. Furthermore, 96% would take more adaptive courses. \n selected comment: \n \n \xe2\x80\x9cI really appreciate being part of this experiment. enjoyed the content-particularly the links to the more in-depth lectures. would recommend it highly.\xe2\x80\x9d \n \n \n \n \n \n Recent Publications: \n \n \n Shelle, GA., Powell, E., Darnall, E., Pilkenton, A., Earnesty, D.

In the past, people who did not accept the contributor agreement could still create and publish content. Replacing that agreement with this new terms of use also includes requirement to accept the terms in order to contribute to extension.org sites. Those not accepting the agreement will not be able to log into eXtension sites. \n Does it matter if my institution is member of eXtension or not? \n Several eXtension tools and services are available to anyone eligible for an eXtension ID regardless of the membership status of their institution. As such, everyone who has contributed, is currently contributing, or may contribute in the future, should be aware of the new terms of use. \n What are 3rd party applications? \n eXtension provides access to the following applications as part of the services offered to the Cooperative Extension System. Access via eXtension to some applications may be dependent on membership status of your institution.

This happens through package of two integrated sites, Campus (a Moodle 3.1+ platform) and Catalog store front facilitating free or fee-based access to courses on Campus.\xc2\xa0 Through incorporating competency frameworks in Campus and then linking course learning objects to elements of those frameworks, one is able to create competency based learning plans connecting learners to the courses and lessons that support those competencies.\xc2\xa0 While competency frameworks can be specified directly within Campus, eXtension also offers the use of framework builder provided by Eduworks Its Competencies and Skills System CASS allows the creation of frameworks in standardized format that is directly connected to Campus as well as other competency based platforms. \n Where is it located? \n The online course site is located at https://campus.extension.org while the catalog is at https://catalog.extension.org \n How do get an account? \n On Campus, using the &#8220;Create new account&#8221; link in the login block, user completes user profile which includes preferred user name, email address, password, and few other required items.\xc2\xa0 Upon submitting this profile, Moodle sends verification message to the email address entered.\xc2\xa0 The user accesses the link in the email message to verify the account, and then proceeds to enroll in courses of interest. \n On Catalog, using the &#8220;Customer Login&#8221; link at the top of the page, user completes an online form, and is able to create an account without the step of the email verification.\xc2\xa0 Either of these methods creates accounts in the same database, so creating an account on Catalog allows the user to log in on Campus, and vice versa. \n Why use it? \n \n Anyone in the world can enroll \n eXtension provides hosting and support \n Makes courses available 24/7/365 \n Provides single site for all eXtension courses \n Allows for multi-institutional collaboration in development \n Provides incorporation of competency frameworks \n Uses commercial storefront for sale of fee-based courses \n \n Who can offer courses on it? \n Anyone employed by an eXtension premium member institution and who has eXtension ID. \n What features does it provide? \n As Moodle 3.1 system, it provides full range of course delivery tools and services such as web pages, video, books, lessons, assignments, forums, chat, certificates, databases, glossaries, quizzes, journals, questionnaires, and competency frameworks. It also allows for sharing of resources and courses with other course developers and Moodle sites. \n What if don&#8217;t have real &#8220;course,&#8221; but just few learning modules? \n &#8220;Course&#8221; is the term used by Moodle to refer to container holding various learning objects.\xc2\xa0 Check out the blog post at https://www.extension.org/2016/01/27/when-is-a-course-not-a-course/ for more detail. \n Other FAQs: \n \n Can charge fees? Yes. Campus is tightly connected to catalog.extension.org which provides store front with built-in Paypal capability.\xc2\xa0 Details about that capability are located at https://www.extension.org/campus-procedures .\xc2\xa0 Other means of charging fees will require the use of an enrollment key issued to the user once payment is made. \n Do have to pay to offer course on this site? \xc2\xa0 No, it is provided as service of eXtension to its premium member institutions. \n Can control access to courses? \xc2\xa0 Moodle, the software running on Campus, provides different forms of access or enrollment control. The standard method is requiring an enrollment key (a password) when enrolling in the course. Issuing the enrollment key is reserved right of course teachers. Teachers can also impose limits in the duration one can be enrolled in course as well as time frames during which enrollment is open. \n How does the site handle video? Video is generally managed in one of three different methods. It can be uploaded as file to the Moodle platform and delivered on demand to the user. teacher can provide link to video on third party site; e.g., YouTube, Vimeo. Or, video can be uploaded through Moodle to Kaltura platform eXtension provides and which streams the video on demand. \n Can offer group activities? Moodle allows for the use of both groups and groupings (groups of groups) as means of controlling content delivery by group as well as exchange of information among participants; e.g., forums and chats among only members of specific group. \n Can Moodle be used for instructor-led courses? Moodle provides several tools that facilitate instructor direct involvement in the learning activity. Forums, journals, chats and assignments are particularly designed for that purpose. Such engagement with the learners is particularly encouraged. \n \n Where do get help with my questions or to get started using this system? \n Send an email to campushelp@extension.org \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n Did you like this article?

CBE will also enhance eXtension\xe2\x80\x99s professional development offerings. With CBE, your programs will align more directly with the roles your programs support, such as volunteer training as well as increasing the skills of Extension professionals. For example, the Climate Learning Network CBE framework identifies the training and resources necessary to become Climate Literate Extension Professional. \n Right now, we are developing tools to align resources and training with the needs of Extension Professionals.

For example, some features of Catalog include: \n \n Bulk purchasing (buying multiple seats) in course with different levels of pricing; i.e., lower price per student once you get over certain number of seats purchased; \n Bundled courses, where for one fee, student can gain access to more than one course; \n Invoicing, in which Catalog generates an invoice to the student.\xc2\xa0 When the payment is received by the eXtension accounting office, Catalog administrator &#8220;releases&#8221; the student to begin accessing the course; \n Discounted pricing through voucher codes that grant different levels of discount&#8211;in either percentage or dollar terms; \n \xe2\x80\x9cBuy Now\xe2\x80\x9d buttons to facilitate payment of course fees from any other website where the buttons are displayed. \n \n For users, Catalog and Campus share login credentials.\xc2\xa0 However, for the new user, Catalog simplifies the process of creating new login account by eliminating the need for email verification&#8211;one of the more frequent issues submitted to the Campus help desk. \n Who can list educational offerings on it? \n Anyone who has eXtension ID. \n Other FAQs: \n \n Where can get help? \xc2\xa0 eXtension staffs help desk to respond to any technical difficulties you may be having with this site.\xc2\xa0 Send an email to cataloghelp@extension.org \n How do know if already have login name on Catalog? If you have enrolled in course at http://campus.extension.org \xc2\xa0 or logged in at that site within the past two years, you likely still have login account. Use the &#8220;Forgotten&#8221; link on the Catalog login page, and you can search for your credentials using either your user name or your email address. \n am an Extension educator. How can get an educational event or course listed in this catalog?\xc2\xa0 Please review the information at http://create.extension.org/node/3180 The help desk staff will consult with you in deciding the most appropriate approach for listing your event or course. \n Since Catalog can list webinars, will this replace Learn? \xc2\xa0 No, it is not practical to do so. Listings in Learn are created self serve by anyone with an eXtension ID.\xc2\xa0 Catalog is not self-serve.\xc2\xa0 Webinars included in Catalog are primarily for those instances where someone wishes to charge fees for access to webinar, or where they might want to package various resources, exams, certificates, badges, etc. to go along with the webinar. Catalog can also be used to broaden the publicity of the webinar. \n What if my educational event or product is not on Campus? While Catalog facilitates seamless transfers to or from Campus, it also accommodates links to external websites and resources.\xc2\xa0 catalog listing could consist of nothing more than description with appropriate links to the external sites. \n \n Where do get help with my questions or to get started using this system? \n Send an email to cataloghelp@extension.org \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n Did you like this article?
